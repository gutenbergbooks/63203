PREFACE.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> appearance of this Second Edition of my translation of
“Faust,” after an interval of more than forty years from the
publication of the original edition, may seem to require a word of
explanation. Very soon after the issue of the first edition I became
convinced that with the usual tendency of ambitious young men, I had
allowed my enthusiasm to overrule my discretion, and ventured upon a
task that demanded a much riper experience of life, and a much more
finished dexterity of execution than was to be expected from a
person of my age and capacity. I accordingly passed a verdict of
condemnation upon it, and&mdash;notwithstanding the more lenient sentence
passed on the work by not a few friendly voices&mdash;continued to regard
it as a juvenile performance, which had done the best service of
which it was capable, by teaching me my ignorance. This verdict was
confirmed in my mind by the appearance of the admirable version of
the same poem by my accomplished friend, Sir Theodore Martin, with
whose laurels, thus nobly earned, I was inclined to think it a sort
of impertinence to interfere. But, as time went on, and, while I was
employing my whole energies on laborious works in quite another
sphere, I still continued to hear people, whose judgment I could not
altogether despise, praising and quoting my “Faust;” in which
partial estimate they were no doubt confirmed by the approval of the
late George Lewes, in his classical Life of Goethe, and of the
Germans generally, who, from the close intercourse I have always
maintained with that people, are inclined to look on my doings in
the field of their literature with a specially favourable eye. Under
these circumstances, it was only natural for me to imagine that the
condemnation I had passed on my first juvenile attempt in verse had
perhaps been too severe; and that, after all, I owed it to myself,
and to Goethe, and to the noble people with whom I had been from my
youth so intimately connected, to give my translation a thorough
revisal, and to republish it in a form which might be as worthy of
the ambition that such an attempt implied as my literary capability
admitted. I accordingly, some four or five years ago, employed the
leisure of the summer months in correcting, and in not a few places
carefully rewriting, the whole work in the shape in which it now
appears.
</p>

<p>
The principal fault which led me to condemn so severely my early
work was a certain deficiency in the easy natural grace, which every
one who knows the great German poet must recognise as one of the
most attractive characteristics of his composition. This deficiency
arose in my case partly from want of experience in the dexterous use
of poetical expression, partly from the habit of clinging too
closely to the words of the original, which is the natural vice of a
young and conscientious translator. Long practice in such matters
has now convinced me that a literal version of a great poem never
can be a graceful version; and poetry without grace is like painting
without colour, or preaching without faith; it lacks the very
feature which makes it what it pretends to be, and gives it a right
to exist. Those who wish to be minutely curious about the <i>ipsissima
verba</i> of a great poem should read a prose translation; the mere
want of the rhythmical movement never can deprive the work of its
ideal character and elevating influence; and in the case of Faust
this has been amply proved by the excellent translation of Mr.
Hayward, which, I believe, has now reached a twelfth edition. But
the problem of the poetical translator is to give, not the words,
but the character of the original; to transfer its spirit, its tone,
its salient features, and its rhythmical attitude, into another
tongue, so far as the capabilities of that other tongue render such
a transference possible. This is the principle on which I have
worked. It would have been easy for me to have made many passages
more literal; but, in doing so, I should have sacrificed the freedom
of handling, without which I am convinced that graceful ease and
naturalness in rhythmical composition is impossible.
</p>

<p>
There are some peculiarities in the rhythm of Faust to which it may
be as well specially to call the attention of the English reader.
While the fundamental metre is the octosyllabic Iambic, there is a
liberal use of the decasyllabic line, whenever the dignity of the
subject seems to require it, and not seldom, too, I fancy, from a
fine instinct which Goethe had to avert what Byron calls “the
fatal facility” of the octosyllabic stanza. This facility the
German poet counteracts also in another way, by the variety of the
places to which he attaches his rhyme; the couplet being constantly
varied with the quatrain, and that either in the way of the
alternate lines rhyming, or the first with the fourth, and the
second with the third. But a still more characteristic feature in
the rhythm of Faust is the frequent use of the Alexandrian line of
twelve syllables, and that, not as Pope and Dryden use it, for
giving greater volume and swell to a closing line, but simply to
indulge an easy motion, such as we may imagine a German to delight
in, when smoking his pipe and sipping his beer on a mild summer
evening, beneath the village lime tree. I request the English reader
particularly to note this peculiarity, and generally to tune his ear
to the varied flow of Goethe’s easy rhythm; otherwise he will be
apt to blame the translator, who certainly is not bound to sacrifice
one of the most characteristic features of his author to propitiate
the favour of the most ignorant, the most uncultivated, and the most
lazy section of his readers. In the strictly lyrical parts of the
poem it will be found that, if not with curious minuteness,
certainly in general tone and effect, I have carefully followed the
movement of the original. To have done otherwise, indeed, would have
been difficult for me, to whom the movement of the original, in all
its changes, has long been as familiar as the responses of the
Church Service to a devout Episcopalian. Only let the reader not
expect from me any attempt to give back on every occasion the
trochaic rhymes or double endings, as we call them, of the original.
Such an attempt will only be made by the writer who is more anxious
to gain applause by performing a difficult feat, than to ensure
grace by conforming to the plain genius of the language in which he
writes.

PRELIMINARY.
</h2>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="sc">The</span> story of Dr. Faustus and the Devil is one of such deep human
significance, and, from the Reformation downwards, of such large
European reputation, that in giving some account of its origin,
character, treatment, legendary and poetical, I shall seem to be
only gratifying a very natural curiosity on the part of the
intelligent reader.
</p>

<p>
We, who live in the nineteenth century, in a period of the world’s
intellectual development, which may be called the age of spiritual
doubt and scepticism, in contradistinction to the age of faith and
reverence in things traditional, which was first shaken to its
centre by the violent shock of the Reformation, can have little
sympathy with the opinions as to spiritual beings, demoniacal
agency, magic, and theosophy, that were so universally prevalent in
the sixteenth century. We believe in the existence of angels and
spirits, because the Scriptures make mention of such spiritual
beings; but this belief occupies a place as little prominent in our
theology, as its influence is almost null in regard to actual life.
In the sixteenth century, however, Demonology and Angelography were
sciences of no common importance; and were, too, a fruitful root
whence the occult lore of the sages, and the witch, ghost, and magic
craft of the many took their rise, and spread themselves out into a
tree, whose branches covered the whole earth with their shadow. From
the earliest Christian fathers, to the last lingering theosophists
of the seventeenth century, we can trace a regular and unshaken
system of belief in the existence of infinite demons and angels in
immediate connection with this lower world, with whom it was not
only possible, but of very frequent occurrence, for men to have
familiar intercourse. Psellus,<a href="#i1b" id="i1a">[i1]</a> the “prince of philosophers,”
does not disdain to enter into a detailed account of the nature and
influence of demons, and seems to give full faith to the very
rankest old wives’ fables of <i>dæmones incubi et succubi</i>,
afterwards so well known in the trials for witchcraft which
disgraced the history of criminal law not more than two centuries
ago. Giordano Bruno, the poet, the philosopher, and free-thinker
of his day, to whom the traditionary doctrines of the Church
were as chaff before the wind, was by no means free from the
belief in magic, the fixed idea of the age in which he lived. “O!
quanta virtus,” says he, in all the ebullition of his vivid fancy,
“O quanta virtus est intersectionibus circulorum et quam sensibus
hominum occulta!!! cum caput draconis in sagittario exstiterit,
diacedio lapide posito in aqua, naturaliter (!) spiritus ad dandum
responsa veniunt.”<a href="#i2b" id="i2a">[i2]</a> The comprehensive mind of Cornelius
Agrippa, the companion of kings and of princes, soon sprung beyond
the Cabbalistical and Platonical traditions of his youth; but not
less is his famous book “De Philosophia Occulta” a good specimen
of the intellectual character of the age in which he lived. The
noted work “De Vanitate Scientiarum” is a child of Agrippa, not
of the sixteenth century. The names of Cardan, Campanella, Reuchlin,
Tritheim, Pomponatius, Dardi, Mirandula, and many others, might be
added as characteristic children of the same spirit-stirring era;
all more or less uniting a strange belief in the most baseless
superstitions, with deep profundity of thought, and comprehensive
grasp of erudition.
</p>

<p>
To understand fully the state of belief in which the intellect of
the sixteenth century stood in regard to magic, astrology,
theosophy, etc., it will be necessary to cast an eye back to the
early history of Christianity and philosophy.
</p>

<p>
There can, in the first place, be no doubt that the genius of the
Christian religion is completely adverse to that exaggerated and
superstitious belief in the power of the Devil and Evil Spirits,
which was so prevalent in the first ages of the Church, and
increased to such a fearful extent in the Middle Ages. The Jewish
religion, too, was founded on the great and fundamental doctrine
that there is but one God, as opposed to the Hindoo and Persian
notion of conflicting divinities, so universally spread over the
East; and all the wild waste of doctrines concerning demons
(διδασκαλίαι δαιμονίων, 1 Tim. iv. 1), with which the fertility of
Rabbinical invention overran the fair garden of Mosaic theology, has
been very properly relegated by German divines to its true source,
the Babylonish captivity. Such, however, is the proneness of human
reason to all sorts of superstition, that, though the New Testament
Scriptures expressly declare<a href="#i3b" id="i3a">[i3]</a> that Jesus Christ came to annihilate
the power, and destroy the works of the Devil, the monotheism of
primitive Christianity was, in a few centuries, magnified into a
monstrous system of demonological theology, little better than
Oriental Dualism. The declension to this superstition was so much
the more easy, as there were not wanting certain passages of
Scripture (Eph. ii. 2, and vi. 12; 2 Thess. ii. 9), which ignorant
and bigoted priests could easily turn to their own purposes, in
magnifying this fancied power of the great enemy of man. A man like
Del Rio would find devils within the walls of the New Jerusalem; so
wonderfully sharp is his Jesuitical nose to scent out even the
slightest motion of infernal agency.
</p>

<p>
The Gnostic and Manichæan heresies which infested the Church during
the first five or six centuries could not be without their influence
in exalting the power of the principle of evil; but writers of a far
more philosophical character and more sober tone than those Oriental
heresiarchs cannot be exempted from the charge of having contributed
fairly to the same result. Of those fathers of the Church who did
not, like Arnobius and Lactantius, exclaim against all philosophy,
as opposed to the simplicity of the gospel, the greater number
belonged to the Alexandrian school of Neo-Platonists, who, with all
their sublime idealism, are known to have cherished, with a peculiar
fondness, some of the most childish and superstitious notions to
which philosophic mysticism has given birth. No lover of piety and
virtue springing from a high and soul-ennobling philosophy, but must
love and reverence the memory of such names as Proclus, Plotinus,
and Jamblichus. It cannot, however, be denied that the overstrained
ideas of these pure spirits went a great way to promote the growth
of the prevalent superstitions with regard to theurgy and magic. The
life of Plotinus seems, from the account given by Porphyry, to have
been considered by himself and his admirers as an uninterrupted
intercourse with spiritual intelligences, yea, with the one original
Spirit himself; and in the Enneads of this prince of philosophic
mystics, we have already fully developed all that system of mutual
sympathies and antipathies, of concords and discords, between the
all-animated parts of that mighty animal the World, which so readily
allowed themselves to be worked into a system of practical theurgy
and magic. Jamblichus, again, was not only a mystical philosopher,
who sought to arrive at union (ἕνωσις) with the Divine Being by
intellectual contemplation, but a magician and theurgist, as his
work on the Egyptian mysteries, and the many legends told of him by
his biographers, sufficiently prove.
</p>

<p>
I have been thus particular in holding forth the decidedly magical
and theurgic character of the Alexandrian School of Platonists, in
the second and third centuries, as it is easy to perceive that the
revival of the Platonic, or rather Neo-Platonic philosophy, on
occasion of the restoration of learning in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, had a principal share in the formation of the
theosophic and magical views of the sixteenth century, which it is
my intention here to characterise. The world had become heartily
sick of the eternal boom-booming of the Aristotelian bitterns.<a href="#i4b" id="i4a">[i4]</a>
The hungry spirit of man, aroused from its lethargic slumber,
demanded some more vital nourishment than the skeleton distinctions
of a thought-dissecting logic, and the vain pomposity of a learned
terminology, could afford; and when such men as Dante, Petrarch, and
Boccacio had taught the world to prefer the fulness of poetical life
to the nakedness of scholastic speculation, no wonder that Plato,
Plotinus, and Proclus, when brought into the West by the learned
fugitives of Constantinople, should have received a hearty welcome,
and exercised a deep-spread influence over the philosophy of the
succeeding centuries. Gemistus Pletho, Bessarion, and Marsilius
Ficinus, are well known as the three principal restorers of the
Platonic philosophy in the fifteenth century: but it deserves
especially to be remarked, that these men were far from being pure
worshippers of their great master, but mixed it up with the theurgic
dreamings of Jamblichus and Porphyry, nay, even went as far back as
Pythagoras and Hermes Trismegistus, and held the simple Platonic
doctrines as of comparatively little consequence, unless taken in
connection with the mighty system which, out of such strange
materials, had been built up by the Neo-Platonists.<a href="#i5b" id="i5a">[i5]</a>
</p>

<p>
In connection with the revival of the Platonic philosophy in Italy,
we cannot omit to mention the name of Reuchlin, whose zeal for
cabbalistical studies is said to have been first excited by the
famous Johannes Picus Mirandula.<a href="#i6b" id="i6a">[i6]</a> Reuchlin was a German, and is
the more interesting to us as the contemporary, or rather the master
and instructor of Agrippa, Melancthon, and many celebrated men of
the sixteenth century, whose names stand immediately connected with
the story of Doctor Faust. To complete the wild dreamings of the
Italian Platonists, nothing was now wanting but a revival of the
Rabbinical and Talmudistic lore; and Reuchlin, whom Europe still
reveres as the father of Hebrew learning in modern Theology, was
precisely the man for this purpose. It was natural that the language
of the sacred Book should have been considered as containing
something mystical and transcendental even in its very letters; and
we need not wonder that the enthusiasm of the first Hebrew scholars
in Germany should have discovers the key of all the sciences in that
cabbalistic lore, which we are now accustomed to use in common
discourse, as a synonym for the most childish and unintelligible
jargon.
</p>

<p>
Taking, thus, the prevailing theology of the Church, in connection
with the impulse which the human mind had received from the revival
of the Platonic philosophy, and the strong reaction, which the
risings of independent thought in the breasts of men like Telesius,
Campanella, and Bruno, had raised against the long-established
despotism of the Aristotelian philosophy,&mdash;and all this worked up to
a point by the revival of Cabbalism, through Reuchlin and other
cultivators of Oriental literature,&mdash;we shall have no difficulty in
perceiving at once the leading features of the age in which Faust
flourished, and the causes which led to their development. We see
the human intellect, in being roused into new life from the icy
night of scholasticism, surrounded by the glowing but unsubstantial
morning-clouds of a philosophy of feeling and imagination.
Sufficiently occupied with gazing, child-like, on the hovering
shapes that teemed so richly from its new-awakened being, it had no
tune, no wish, to enter upon the severe task of conscious manhood,
that of criticising its own powers, and defining, with cautious
precision, what the mind of man can know, and what it cannot
know,&mdash;and was thus destined, for a short season, to flounder
through the misty regions of theosophy and magic, till it should
learn, from experience, to find at once its starting-point and its
goal, in the exhaustless fulness of actual Nature.
</p>

<p>
In such an age, and under the influence of opinions, religious and
philosophical, so different from those now prevalent, flourished the
mysterious hero of modern magic, whom the pen of Goethe has made,
likewise, one of the principal heroes of modern poetry. That a good
deal of obscurity should have gathered around such a
character,&mdash;that the love of the marvellous should have united with
the ignorance of the age, in magnifying juggling tricks into
miracles of magic, and clouding with a poetical mistiness that which
was clear and definite,&mdash;is not to be wondered at. But that such a
character actually existed, the tradition perpetuated from age to
age on its native soil, and found, with little variation, scattered
over almost every country, and clothed in almost every language of
Europe, is of itself sufficient evidence. Popular legends seldom
spring, like the antediluvian and prelapsarian traditions of the
Talmudists, or the genealogies of old Celtic families, from mere
airy nothingness; and, however contradictory and inconsistent their
integrant parts may appear, they have all formed themselves around a
nucleus of substantial reality. Nevertheless, as there is nothing so
absurd which has not been asserted by some one of the philosophers,
so there have not been wanting men of learning and investigation,
who have seriously set themselves to the task of proving away the
personality of the renowned Doctor Faust.<a href="#i7b" id="i7a">[i7]</a> But to detect a few
chronological inaccuracies in the common popular legend, and to hold
out to merited contempt the silliness, and even the impossibility of
many things contained in it, may afford an opportunity for the
display of a pedantic erudition, but can give no ground for the
sweeping conclusion that the person, of whom these stories are told,
did actually never exist. The monks were clever fellows; but, with
all their ability, they would have found it difficult to invent such
a story as Faust&mdash;so generally believed&mdash;out of mere nothing. The
sceptics themselves are sensible of this; and, accordingly, Dürr,
the chief of them, while he denies the personality of Faust the
magician, endeavours to give a probable reason for the prevalence of
the story, by throwing the whole burden upon the back of Faust the
printer, father-in-law of Peter Schoeffer, and fellow-workers both
of Guttenburg,&mdash;the famous trio, among whom the honour of the
invention of printing is divided. The envy of the monks, acting on
the ignorance of the age, here comes most opportunely into play, to
explain how the inventor of such a novel art of multiplying books
should have been generally accounted a magician. There can, indeed,
be little doubt that he was so accounted by many ignorant people;
and as this idea is sufficiently poetical, Klingemann has taken
advantage of it in his tragedy of Doctor Faust.<a href="#i8b" id="i8a">[i8]</a> The main
objection, however, on the face of this theory, is, that all the
legends of Faust agree in placing the hero of magic fully half a
century later than Faust the printer, who flourished about 1440. It
is true, indeed, that some of the <i>Volksbücher</i> (<i>vide</i> Dürr, <i>ut
supra</i>) ascribe to the Emperor Maximilian, what is generally told of
Charles V., viz. that Doctor Faust conjured up before him the
apparitions of Alexander the Great and his queen; but the other
tricks, which were played before Cardinal Campegio and Pope Adrian,
agree better with the age of Charles V. than with that of
Maximilian. It is quite possible, however, that Faust may have
exhibited his magical skill before both these emperors, whose reigns
occupied the space from 1492 to 1558, Maximilian dying in 1519; for
even the date of Maximilian will never bring us back to the era when
Faust the printer was in his glory.
</p>

<p>
The personality of Faust, however, is not left to rest upon the mere
traditionary evidence of the vulgar legend. The diligence of German
antiquaries, even before Goethe’s Faust gave importance to the
theme, had collected many trustworthy historical testimonies in
confirmation of the common belief. Dürr’s Letter on this subject
is dated 1676; and, not seven years afterwards, appeared Neumann’s
historical disquisition <i>De Fausto praestigiatore</i>. This essay I
have not seen at full length; but from the epitome given of it by
Hauber (<i>Bibliotheca Magica</i>, vol. ii. p. 706), I fear that there
may be but too much cause for the remark of Heumann,<a href="#i9b" id="i9a">[i9]</a> that “it
smacks too much of the young graduate.” It was certainly a very
pious motive that induced Neumann, a student of Wittenberg, to
attempt removing from his <i>alma mater</i> the shame of having given
birth, or even education, to such a notorious character as Doctor
Faust; but truth often forces us to admit what fondest prejudice
would fain deny. The next critical essay on Faust, is that of
Heumann, just quoted, in Hauber’s Library of Magic, and it
contains the most important of these historical testimonies to the
truth of the Faustish legend, which have since been so
comprehensively exhibited in one work by Doctor Stieglitz.<a href="#i10b" id="i10a">[i10]</a>
</p>

<p>
As all the traditions agree in representing Faust as haying studied
at Wittenberg, and there, too, exhibited a number of magical tricks
to his good friends the students, it was natural to suspect that
Luther or Melancthon should, somewhere or other, make mention of
such a notorious character. And, accordingly, Stieglitz follows
Horst (<i>Zauber-Bibliotheck</i>, vi. 87) in asserting that Melancthon
actually does make mention of Doctor Faust in one of his epistles;
but as neither of these writers cites the passage, or mentions in
what particular part of Melancthon’s work it is to be found, I
barely mention this circumstance on their authority. There is,
however, very great probability that the testimony of Joannes
Manlius, in his Collectanea, the principal one relied on both by
Heumann and Stieglitz, is, in reality, to be considered as a
testimony of Melancthon. Manlius himself<a href="#i11b" id="i11a">[i11]</a> says of his
Collectanea, “<i>Labor hic noster collectus ex ore D. Phillippi
Melanchthonis allisque clarissimis viris</i>,” and might, on this
account, as Heumann remarks, have fitly been named <i>Melancthoniana</i>,
or Melancthon’s Table-Talk. But be this as it may, Manlius’
testimony is most decided, and runs as follows:&mdash;“I was acquainted
with a certain person, called Faust of Kundling, a small town in
Wurtemberg. He was a Cracovian Scholasticus, and read lectures on
magic in the university there. He was a great rambler (<i>vagabatur
passim</i>), and possessed many secrets. At Venice, wishing to amuse
the populace, he boasted that he would fly up to heaven. The devil
accordingly wafted him up a certain height, but dashed him down
again in such a plight, that he lay half-dead on the ground. A few
years ago, the same John Faust, on the last day of his life, was
found sitting in the common inn of a certain village in the Duchy of
Wittenberg. He was, indeed, a most vile blackguard (<i>turpissimus
nebula</i>), of a most filthy life, so much so, indeed, that he once
and again almost lost his life on account of his excesses. The
landlord of the inn asked him why he sat there so sad, contrary to
his wont? “Be not terrified if you shall hear anything on this
night,” was his short answer. And at midnight the house was
shaken. Next morning, near mid-day, as Faust did not make his
appearance, the landlord entered into his chamber, and found him
lying beside his bed, with his face on the ground, having been so
slain by the devil. When he was yet alive, he was accompanied by a
dog, which was the devil. ... This Faust the magician, a most vile
beast, and a common sewer of many devils (<i>cloaca multorum
diabolorum</i>), was also a great boaster, and pretended that all the
victories of the Imperial armies in Italy were gained by the help of
his magic.”<a href="#i12b" id="i12a">[i12]</a> With this account agrees exactly that given by
Wier,<a href="#i13b" id="i13a">[i13]</a> the disciple and confidant of the celebrated Cornelius
Agrippa von Nettesheim. Del Rio,<a href="#i14b" id="i14a">[i14]</a> who wrote at the end of the
sixteenth century, introduces him along with the same Agrippa,
playing tricks on the poor landlords, with whom they sojourned in
their vagabond excursions, by paying them with money which turned
into crumbs and chaff, whenever the magicians were out of sight; but
his connection with such a philosopher as Agrippa is much to be
doubted, as Wier has not even hinted at it in the passage where he
treats expressly of the Doctor.
</p>

<p>
The only other contemporary writer from whom I shall quote at
length, is Begardi<a href="#i15b" id="i15a">[i15]</a> whose book, <i>Zeyger der Gesundheit</i>,” was
published in 1539, and contains the following interesting testimony
to the age and character of Faust, which I give here from the
German, as it stands in Dr. Stieglitz’s essay.
</p>

<p>
“There is yet a celebrated character whom I would rather not have
named; but since I must mention him, I will tell what I know of him
in a few words. Some years ago this man passed through almost all
lands, princedoms, and kingdoms, making his name known to everybody,
and making great show of his skill, not in medicine only, but in
chiromancy, necromancy, physiognomy, visions in crystals, and such
like. And in these things he not only acquired great notoriety, but
also obtained the name of a famous and experienced master. He did
not conceal his name, but called himself Faust, and used to
subscribe himself <i>philosophus philosophorum</i>. But of those who were
cheated by him, and complained of the same to me, there is a great
multitude. His promise was great like that of Thessalus in Galen’s
days, as also his fame like that of Theophrastus;<a href="#i16b" id="i16a">[i16]</a> but his
deeds, as I have heard, were almost always found to be very petty
and deceitful, though he was, to speak plainly, not slow at giving,
and especially taking, money, as many a worthy person had cause to
know. But now the matter is not to be remedied; past is past, and
gone is gone. I must even leave the matter as it is; and see thou to
it, that thou treat it as a good Christian ought to do.”
</p>

<p>
Thus far Begardi in his honest naïve language. Heumann cites
further a long passage from Tritheim’s Epistolæ Familiares,<a href="#i17b" id="i17a">[i17]</a>
describing a character altogether similar to that above described by
Manlius and Begardi; with this remarkable difference, that he is not
called Doctor John Faust, as he is by Manlius, and in all the vulgar
traditions, but “<i>Magister Georgius Faustus Sabellicus, Faustus
Junior.</i>” I think Stieglitz has been too precipitate in concluding
that difference in the name must necessarily imply a difference in
the person. The vagabond wonder-workers of those days were wont to
have a number of names, as the example of Paracelsus alone is
sufficient to show. With regard to the denomination of “Faustus
<i>junior</i>,” this cannot certainly refer to our John Faust, with
whom this George (if he was a different person) must have been
contemporary. It probably relates to Faust the printer, who has also
been accused of magic, or to some other Faust of the fifteenth
century, whose fame has been now swallowed up in that of Doctor John
Faust of Wittenberg.
</p>

<p>
Camerarius and Gesner<a href="#i18b" id="i18a">[i18]</a> also make mention of Doctor Faust; but
let the passages already quoted suffice to prove the historical
reality of our magical hero.
</p>

<p>
Joining together these historical testimonies and the popular
traditions, it is not difficult to come to a pretty accurate
conclusion as to the real character of Doctor Faust. He appears to
have been a man of extensive learning, especially in medical and
astrological, perhaps too in philological and theological, science.
But, driven by a restless spirit, and a vain desire of popular
applause, he seems to have early abandoned the calm and steady path
that leads to professional eminence, and sought after that noisy but
less substantial fame, which his scientific skill was fitted to
procure for him in the eyes of the gazing multitude. Many of the
greatest philosophers, indeed, as Solomon, Roger Bacon, and
Cornelius Agrippa, have been accounted magicians for no other reason
than their uncommon wisdom, far surpassing that of the age in which
they lived; but there is too much reason to suspect that Faust’s
fame as a magician rests upon much more questionable grounds, and
the whole account of his life and exploits leaves upon our mind the
impression that he was a very clever vagabond quack, rather than a
retired and contemplative philosopher. There is much in all that is
told of him that recalls to our mind the biography of Paracelsus, a
man certainly of great genius, but of much greater impudence, who
gained his living by acting upon the folly of mankind.<a href="#i19b" id="i19a">[i19]</a> By all
accounts, indeed, Faust was a man of much more distinguished
academic learning than Paracelsus, of whom historians even question
whether he ever studied at any university; but as a vagabond, a
boaster, and a wonder-promiser, the one is perhaps only not superior
to the other. With a little knowledge of medicine, a little
classical lore, some dexterity in performing sleight-of-hand
wonders, and a panoply of assurance, a clever man like Faust or
Paracelsus may easily obtain a livelihood, and, what is more, an
imperishable name. For such characters a strolling life is at once a
pleasure and a necessity. Paracelsus soon lost his chair at
Basle,&mdash;for a man is never a hero to his <i>valet-de-chambre</i>,&mdash;and,
if we may believe the common legend, Faust scarcely left a corner of
the earth unvisited, and filled Asia and Europe with his renown.
</p>

<p>
And verily he has had his reward. Since the time of his death, not
only Germany, but England, France, and Holland, have swarmed with
“prodigious and lamentable histories” of the “great magician
John Faust, with his testament and his terrible death.” Magical
books under his name have become as famous as those of
Solomon;<a href="#i20b" id="i20a">[i20]</a> artists and poets have vied with one another in
rendering his name immortal in the annals of Art; tragedies and
comedies, puppet-plays and operas, ballads and novels, essays, and
dissertations and commentaries, prologues and epilogues, and all the
varied paraphernalia of genius and erudition, have been heaped on
one another, to adorn the trophy of Doctor John Faustus, the great
German quack. The wondrous exploits of Faust are endless, and it
would be an endless task to recount the tithe of them. Were I to
enter upon an exposition of how Doctor Faust first cited
Mephistopheles on a crossroad in the midst of a dark fearful wood
near Wittenberg,&mdash;how the Devil visited him frequently in his own
study in all shapes and sizes,&mdash;how the Doctor was, after some
hesitation, prevailed on to sell his soul to Lucifer, and to that
effect signed a formal bond with blood drawn from his own arm,&mdash;how
he neglected all the warnings of his good genius, and even the
terrible writing that appeared on his wounded arm, <span class="sc">Homo Fuge</span>!&mdash;how
the wily Devil dissuaded him from the quiet of a domestic life, when
he wished to marry, that he might drag him into all kinds of
licentiousness,&mdash;how he forced Mephistopheles to answer all his
importunate interrogatories, as to the state of Hell, and the
condition of the damned, which the Devil painted in colours as
terrible as if he had been an Evangelist of the north-west Highland
type,&mdash;how Faust was transported into Hell upon the back of
Beelzebub, and left floundering through the chaos of the abyss,&mdash;how
he travelled from star to star, and surveyed all the infinity of
worlds, with as much expedition as the imagination of a modern
poet,&mdash;how he turned astrologer, and vied with the fame of
Nostradamus,&mdash;how he wandered over the whole world, and saw Rome,
which is a city where there is a river called Tiber, and Naples,
which is the birthplace of Virgil, who was also a great magician,
and caused a passage to be made through the rock of Posilippo, in
one night, a whole mile long,&mdash;how he played the devil in the
Sultan’s seraglio, and passed himself off for Mahomet with the
ladies of the palace,&mdash;how he sat invisible at the Pope’s banquet,
and whipped away all the tit-bits from the plates of Pope Adrian and
his assessors of the scarlet stockings, so that his Holiness was
obliged to believe that some tormented soul from Purgatory was
haunting the Vatican, and ordered prayers to be made
accordingly,&mdash;how he further showed his enmity to the Church by
making secret broaches in the wine-casks of the Bishop of
Saltzburg’s cellar, and being on one occasion surprised by the
butler, perched the poor wretch upon a tree, where he sprawled like
a limed bird for the whole length of a frosty night,&mdash;how he called
up the apparition of Alexander the Great and his Queen before the
Emperor Charles V., who assured himself of the reality of this
vision by touching the wart which history reports to have been upon
the hero’s neck,&mdash;how in like manner he frightened the students of
Erfurt by raising the ghost of Polypheme, and bewitched his good
friends the students, and himself to boot, by the apparition of the
beautiful Helena,&mdash;how he bamboozled a boor by promising him a penny
for as much hay as he could eat from his waggon, and then swallowing
the whole cart-load down, as easily as it had been a spoonful of
Sauerkraut,&mdash;how he sold a fine horse for a small price to a jockey,
who, delighted with the bargain, set off galloping upon this
wightest of steeds, till he came to a running stream, in the middle
of which, and just where the water was deepest, the animal all at
once changed into a bottle of straw, and left the poor rider
floundering up to the neck in the flood,&mdash;how he caused horns to
grow out of a certain freeborn gentleman’s temples, when he was
sleeping with his head out of the window, in such a manner that,
when he awoke, like an ox in a stile, he could neither move
backwards nor forwards,&mdash;and how, finally, he at last met with the
death which his shameful life merited, and was torn in pieces by the
Devil with such violence, that the whole house was shaken as by an
earthquake.&mdash;To narrate all, or one tithe of these wonderful events,
would require more pages than the circulating libraries would
tolerate, and far exceed the limits of these introductory remarks.
I, however, the less regret that I am unable to enter at length upon
this theme, as the task has been already performed, partly by Kit
Marlow, and partly by Mr. Roscoe,<a href="#i21b" id="i21a">[i21]</a> in a collection of German
tales, which I may presume to be accessible to most of my readers.
</p>

<p>
Let us ask now what materials this story possesses, which have so
recommended it to the genius of modern Europe for a high dramatic
treatment; and for an answer to this question happily we have not
far to seek. The moral significance of the legend lies on the
surface of the popular chap-book; and the dramatic writer who should
have omitted it altogether, would have proved himself unworthy of
the noble function which he exercises. ’Tis the world-old story of
the pride of knowledge, and the impatience of limitation with which
that knowledge is often accompanied. “<span class="sc">Eritis sicut Deus, scientes
bonum et malum</span>.” “Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and
evil.” The desire to be as God, looking into the soul of things,
and commanding the mystical machinery of the universe, is the rank
outblossoming of an unchastened intellectual ambition, leading
naturally to discontent with the common human limits of the
knowable, and to a morbid intermeddling with supernatural powers and
forces, in order to lift the lofty speculator, out of the vulgar
sphere of confined humanity. This kicking against the bars of finite
knowledge is of course rebellion against the constitution of things,
disownment of the divine authority which imposed these limitations,
and alliance with the Evil Spirit, whom popular belief acknowledges
as the incarnation of that spirit of impatience, pride, and
presumption, out of which this rebellion springs. Here we have the
real motive which gives moral dignity and human interest to the
legend of Faust. The compact of the Wittenberg doctor with
Mephistopheles is only a striking instance of what is constantly
taking place in the thinking world before us, especially in these
days of curious microscopic prying into the seeds of things, and
pretentious parading of all sorts of dogmatic and negative
philosophies, ambitiously engaged in the insane attempt to explain
the existence of a reasonable world, independent of a reasonable
cause. “Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.” It is the
greed of knowledge, where knowledge is not possible, and the lack of
love and reverence, the indispensable conditions of moral sanity,
that in ages of dreamy speculation lead to the practice of magic and
necromancy, and in days of nice scientific measurement, to a hollow
and heartless atheism, clothing itself in the philosopher’s mantle
and accepted as wisdom by the unthinking. This aspect of the Faust
legend, accordingly, did not escape the notice of Marlow, who has
set it forth prominently, if not profoundly, in the opening scene of
his drama; a scene which bears, indeed, a striking likeness to the
opening scene in Goethe’s poem, in the fashion that a rough-hewn
Highland hut is the same sort of thing as a neat English cottage,
only in a more rude and unscientific style. A secondary element
contained in the Faust legend arises out of the reaction which, in
certain natures, is apt to plunge disappointed intellectual ambition
into a course of sensual indulgence. The key to the invisible world
being denied us, let us make what we can of the visible. If we
cannot be as gods in our knowledge, at least let us be men in our
enjoyments, as largely and as deeply as to our sensuous nature is
allowed; and, to attain this, let us overlook all bounds of vulgar
morality and petty propriety; for to acknowledge these would be only
to substitute one kind of cribbing limitation for another; and
limitation of any kind is what the proud heart of the intellectually
ambitious will not accept. But, to scorn all limit and regulation in
the exercise of our social instincts is to practice systematic
selfishness; in other words, to call in the aid of the author of
Evil, to enable us to gratify our sensual passions in the grandest
style; which of course leads in the end to the ruin of all parties
concerned, and of some who are only accidentally connected with the
direct offender. This is the tragedy of Faust, as handled by the
great German poet, and handled in a style which bids fair to keep it
prominently in the general European eye, as long as Dante’s divine
comedy and Shakespeare’s Hamlet. But there is another element in
the popular legend which both Marlow and Goethe have used, and which
stands to the moral kernel of the story, pretty much as the witch
atmosphere in which Macbeth moves to Macbeth’s personal career.
Faust is a magician, as well as a thinker; and his alliance with the
Powers of Evil implied not merely that all sources of sensual
gratification should be placed at his disposal; but specially that a
power over Nature should be granted him, in virtue of which, by
asserting his superiority over the vulgar conditions of space and
time, by which humanity is bound, his vanity might be flattered, and
his person raised to a platform of public estimation with which
neither Pope, nor Kaiser, nor any earthly dignity might contend.
Faust, therefore, must appear as an exhibitor of magical tricks;
and, as this is the vulgar and shallow element of the legend, it
naturally plays the principal part both in the common chap-book, and
in the dramatic adaptation of Marlow, whose handling of the legend
altogether is commonplace, and, except in some of the lighter parts
of sharp repartee, certainly not worthy of his reputation as one of
the heralds of Shakespeare in the early history of the great English
drama. Goethe, on the other hand, has wisely given these juggling
tricks a very subordinate place in his treatment of the legend; the
scene in Auerbach’s cellar being, I think, the only thing of the
kind directly taken from the chap-book; and brought in also with
great wisdom, in order to make it plain that Faust, with all his
strongly sensual tendencies, was essentially an intellectual
creature, who could not be seduced even by the Devil into any
sympathetic fellowship with the pot-companions of a public
beer-cellar. He felt, however, strongly, at the same time, that, as
in the case of Macbeth, with which he was well acquainted, some wild
and grotesque atmosphere was necessary for the magic doctor to
figure in when he was not occupied directly with his love adventure;
so he followed our great dramatist in making the witches’ cauldron
as necessary to his hero’s passion as it was to Macbeth’s
ambition; and along with this thoroughly mediæval and altogether
appropriate adjunct of the witches’ kitchen, he contrived to bring
in afterwards the wild and weird traditions of a supernatural
character which attach to the famous Brocken mountain, the central
and topmost elevation of the great ridge of the Harz in Northern
Germany; thus rooting his poem locally in the fatherland as firmly
as Walter Scott did for us in Scotland when he made the soft
beauties of Tweedside, and the picturesque grandeur of the
Perthshire Highlands, inseparably associated with the creations of
his poetic fancy. And this brings me to a fourth element in the
legend with which Marlow did not require to concern himself
particularly, but which, from a great poet of Goethe’s character
and with Goethe’s position, could not receive a perfunctory
treatment. If the native home of the whole legend is in all its
parts essentially German, most especially German is its connection
with Wittenberg, and through it with the German University system.
Not only the general speculative tendency so characteristic of our
trans-Rhenane brethren, but the special academic and scholastic hue
of their learning, is vividly portrayed in this national drama. Not
more native to the Cumberland meres is Wordsworth, and to the banks
of Doon is Robert Burns, than Goethe’s <i>Faust</i> is to Göttingen,
Leipzig, and Bonn. A university in Germany is socially a more
powerful thing, though architecturally and aristocratically by no
means so magnificent a thing as Oxford in England. The German
professors are the great representatives and leaders of the national
mind in all departments of thought; this is the case only to a
certain limited extent in our country. The academical element,
therefore, must assert a prominent place in a truly German national
poem. And so it is here. The learned Doctor who sells his soul to
the Devil was a professor; a man of books certainly, and a trainer
of youth; and some of the most suggestive scenes in the poem are
those in which the contrast between mere academical learning with
the wisdom of deeper thought and the living experience of life is
hit off with a few rapid but telling strokes.
</p>

<p>
I have no desire to preoccupy the judgment of the English reader by
any detailed criticism of the merits and defects of Faust as a
dramatic poem. As a tale of human interest it will always be largely
appreciated, even beyond the circle of strictly poetical readers;
and readers of a more specially cultivated taste will not allow any
small faults that might readily be pointed out, whether in the
structure of the poem or in the treatment of the characters, to
interfere with their enjoyment of so rare a combination of profound
thought, wise observation, and deep pathos, as this famous
production exhibits. I will take the liberty, however, of suggesting
to the students of the poem a careful comparison with Lord Byron’s
Manfred, and our great dramatist’s Hamlet, as particularly
fruitful in valuable conclusions. All Byron’s characters, as the
offspring of pride and unchastened ambition, are in a certain sense
Fausts, but Manfred in a particular degree; and, though the idea
that Byron’s tragedy was borrowed from Goethe’s could proceed
only from a superficial knowledge of his lordship’s character, and
from an ignorance of the circumstances which gave rise to the
composition of that poem, it is not the less certain that there is a
great resemblance between the character of Manfred and that of
Faust. From what this resemblance proceeds Lord Byron has himself
most satisfactorily told us:&mdash;“It was the Steinbach, and the
Jungfrau, and <i>something else</i>, much more than Faust,”<a href="#i22b" id="i22a">[i22]</a> that
produced the gigantic Titan-like apparition of Manfred. That
<i>something else</i> here mentioned was Lord Byron himself, who, had he
lived in the sixteenth century, would probably enough have been a
magician (at all events a Giordano Bruno), and might have been
immortalised by some modern poet as the great English Doctor Faust.
How, then, does Manfred stand as compared with Faust? Exactly in the
same way, we must assume, as Byron stands when contrasted with
Goethe. Byron is more sublime; Goethe more human. Byron has more
wing; Goethe a better use of his wing. Byron is more intense, more
impetuous, and more forcible; Goethe more rich, more various, more
mellow, and more ripe. But the chief difference is this, that in all
his poetry Goethe is wise; Byron never. Accordingly, we may say that
with all its grandeur Manfred is essentially a mad poem. It
overleaps the bounds of all sane thinking with no apparent purpose,
and certainly with little apparent effect but the glorification of
monstrous pride. Still there is a moral lesson at the root of the
story, if the reader will take the trouble to think it out. The man
who could find no pleasure in existence, except in the gratification
of an unnatural passion, could end only as Manfred ended, and die
communing with his own proud soul and the evoked spirits of earth
and air, amid the frost-bound ridges of the Alps. But, in order to
attain this solitary Titanic sublimity, the poet has sacrificed all
human probability and all human interest. It is a sublime poem,
Manfred; but it is the sublime of monstrosity. The sublime of the
Prometheus of Æschylus is a very different thing: it is the
sublime, in the first place, not of an unnatural man, but of a god;
and, in the second place, it is the sublime of a soul inspired by
ill-regulated philanthropy, not by unchastened passion. I presume
there are few things finer in the English language than that
midnight soliloquy in the third act of Manfred, when the Count,
looking forth from his lonely tower on the stars and the
snow-shining mountains, recalls a night spent amid the ruins of the
Colosseum, and the palace of the Cæsars in Rome&mdash;a soliloquy which
certainly will lose nothing by a detailed comparison with the
strikingly similar monologue in the fourth act of Goethe’s great
poem; but the misfortune is, when admiration has been spent on
particular passages, one can take no general impression away from
the work except this, that the poet wrote under the influence of
some sad disease of morbid sublimity, and his heroes were made in
Titanic proportions, after his own likeness. In every view,
therefore, except in regard to the power of one or two individual
passages, the study of Manfred can only tend to raise in the mind of
the reader a most profound admiration for the more healthy tone, the
more ripe wisdom, the more rich material, and the more skilful
treatment, of the German writer. With Shakespeare’s great work it
is quite otherwise. Hamlet unquestionably has many striking points
of similarity with Faust. The same moody melancholy, and tendency to
contemplation of suicide; the same lofty discontent with his
environment, and misanthropic contempt for the humanity with which
he stood in direct relationship; the same communion with the unseen
world, though in a different form; the same feebleness and
indecision of character in the hero, with occasional blind plunges
into strokes that hurry himself and others into ruin. In his morbid
state of mind the ghost acts according to the same law on the hero
of our great English tragedy that Mephistopheles does on the German
doctor; but the ghost in the one case for the Devil, in the
other&mdash;though both incarnated creations of a diseased
mind&mdash;indicates in the strongest possible way the diverse character
of the disease. Hamlet is an essentially noble character sunk into
melancholy by the abnormal character of the immediate social element
in which it was his destiny to move; the moody contemplation of the
social wrongs which were rife round about him generated the idea of
revenge, or taking the moral law into his own hand; and of this rash
idea of revenge the ghost is dramatically the voice and the spur.
But, though plunging himself and his environment into misery by
following out his bloody suggestions, Hamlet never forfeits our
respect. He is never selfish; and suffers more from excessive
sensibility to the sins of others than from any faults that may be
placed fairly at his own door. Otherwise with Faust; he is at bottom
a compound of a sentimentalist and a sensualist; and, though the
metaphysical perplexities in which at the outset of his career he is
found entangled, excite in the reader some emotion of pity, yet the
feebleness and irresolution of his conduct afterwards, the ease with
which he allows himself to be dragged by his fiendish guide through
all kinds of selfish indulgence and moral meanness, cannot fail to
inoculate the reader with a strong feeling of contempt. This no
doubt was meant by the poet; and very properly so; as a noble
character never could have fallen into the sensual trap so cunningly
laid for him by the Tempter; still it is a misfortune to the piece,
and imperatively demands the large compensation which it receives
from the profound tragic interest with which the consummate art of
the dramatist has contrived to invest the closing scenes with poor
Margaret.

<p>
It is well known to the literary public that the author of Faust, as
generally read by foreigners, always looked upon this production as
only the first part of the great “<i>Divinia Comedia</i>,” to use the
language of Dante’s time, with which he was to enrich the
literature of his century. The incomplete character of the first
part, indeed, is distinctly indicated in the introductory scene
called the “Prologue to Heaven,” which contains the following
lines:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0q">“Though now he serve me stumblingly, the hour</p>
<p class="i0">Is nigh, when I shall lead him into light.</p>
<p class="i0">When the tree buds, the gardener knows that flower</p>
<p class="i0">And fruit will make the coming season bright.”<a href="#i23b" id="i23a">[i23]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>
To a “divine comedy,” indeed, in the large style, which should
contain a vindication of the ways of God to man, a second part of
Faust was as necessary as Dante’s Paradiso was to his Inferno, or
the <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> of Æschylus to the <i>Prometheus Bound</i>, or
the last four chapters of the Book of Job to the rest of the poem;
and when Goethe wrote this Prologue in Heaven&mdash;a piece by no means
necessary to Faust as an acting play&mdash;it is impossible to imagine
that he had not then distinctly purposed and dimly planned the
singular poem now known as the second part of Faust. For the sake,
therefore, of those readers of the great German tragedy, within the
scope of whose vision the second part of Faust is, for various
reasons, never likely to come, I will set down here a somewhat
detailed panoramic view of that remarkable production. A few
remarks, then, will enable any person of common intelligence to
understand the exact relation which exists between the two works.
</p>

<p>
The first act opens with a pleasing landscape scene, in the midst of
which Faust is discovered reclining upon a flowery turf, weary,
restless, and seeking repose. The hour is twilight, and round the
weary one Ariel and other quaint and pleasant Spirits are hovering
in airy circles, entertaining his fancy with lovely shows, and
lulling him with sweet sounds; quite a piece of Nature’s most
voluptuous and luxuriant beauty, such as Goethe’s soul delighted
to bathe in. As the Spirits continue their song, accompanying the
watches of the night, the dawn approaches to the ear of mortal men
calmly and gently, but to the sense of Spirits, the march of the
hours is heard as a storm: the gigantic rock-gates of the East creak
fearfully; Phœbus rolls his chariot wheels in thunder; and eye and
ear are startled at the strong coming of the day. Faust then wakens,
and gratefully welcomes the fresh tide of a renewed existence which,
after the soothing influences of the magic sleep, seems to stream in
upon him. A resolution is strongly stirred in his breast to strive
after the highest perfection of which human nature is capable.
</p>

<p>
The second scene brings us from the fairy into the court atmosphere.
The Emperor sits on his throne, surrounded by all sorts of
courtiers, ministers, and other appendages of Majesty; the
astrologer and the fool, significantly for those times (for we must
suppose the end of the fifteenth or the beginning of the sixteenth
century), occupying not the least conspicuous place. Forthwith
begins a somewhat prolix discourse between the Imperial Majesty and
his principal ministers&mdash;Chancellor, Treasurer, Master of the
Household, etc., the burden of which is&mdash;a very common one with
great people and people in office&mdash;that they have no money and are
at their wit’s end how to get it. The fool, into whose shoes
Mephistopheles has cunningly shuffled himself, is applied to for the
aid of his sage counsels, and is not slow with the common resource
of German devils and necromancers&mdash;hidden treasures. But before the
spade and the mattock can be brought into play to unearth this
hidden heap, as it happens to be Carnival, there must be a
masquerade. The Emperor, too, has just come from Rome, whither he
had gone, according to the laudable old custom of the Heinrichs and
Ottos and Friedrichs, to get himself dubbed Holy Roman Emperor, and
with his crown on his head, he has brought also the fool’s cap.
Scene third, accordingly, exhibits a rich show of foolery and
masquerading of all sorts. Flower-girls and gardeners; mothers and
daughters; fishers, fowlers, and foresters; Pulcinellos, parasites,
and drunkards; poets and critics; the three Graces, Aglaia,
Hegemone, and Euphrosyne; the three Fates, Atropos, Clotho, and
Lachesis; the three Furies, Alecto, Megæra, and Tisiphone; Fear,
Hope, and Providence leading in Victory, who stands on the top
parapet of a tower&mdash;all this moves in motley operatic splendour
before the eyes of the spectator; and the various personages, as
they pass, festoon themselves, so to speak, with short speeches and
moral reflections in the style of the masques of our old English
dramatists&mdash;points prettily enough curled and frizzled, and
agreeable enough, doubtless, to hear with music in an opera, but
rather wearisome to read in a long sequence as part of a written
play. Then, that Doctor Faust may have something to do in his own
peculiar province of magic, for the command of which, as we know, he
has sold his soul to the Devil, we have a grand chariot brought upon
the stage by four horses; and in this chariot are two allegorical
personages, the charioteer boy (<i>Knabenlenker</i>), that is to say,
Poetry or intellectual wealth, and Plutus, the god of material
wealth, a character fitly sustained by Doctor Faust himself. These
two scatter their riches profusely among the mob of masquers&mdash;Poetry
pearls and spangles, which turn into moths and beetles as soon as
snatched; Plutus golden guineas and silver pennies; but they are red
hot, and burn the fingers of the appropriators. A general row takes
place, which, however, is only the overture to a greater one, with
which the masquerade concludes. Preceded and surrounded by dancing
groups of fauns and satyrs, giants, nymphs, and gnomes, the Emperor
appears in the character of the great Pan, the All of the world
(πᾶν). Plutus, <i>i.e.</i> Faustus, is now ready to close the scene
with a fire trick, like to that which, on the first start of his
magical career, he played off upon Brander, Siebel, Frosch, and the
other worthies of Auerbach’s cellar. The little dwarfish gnomes
take the mighty Pan by the hand and lead him to a hole in the rock,
whence a fountain of fire wells out with many a freakish spurt of
subterranean flame. This the universal δαίμων, or mighty Pan, beholds
with infinite satisfaction; but lo! as he bends forward to
contemplate such miracle more near, his beard unglues itself and
catches fire; and the flame begins to play about at a furious rate,
cracking like a whip right and left, and with long snaky tongues
licking the roof of the welkin. The stage is now one web of
confusion and consternation; all hands are at work to clap
extinguishment on the earth-born flame; but the more they plash and
potter in the wild element, the more it blazes, and the cry is
raised&mdash;Oh treason!&mdash;that the Emperor is burning; whereupon the
herald very appropriately lifts up the moral complaint:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0q">“O Youth, O Youth! and wilt thou never</p>
<p class="i0">Learn to rein thy fancies flighty?</p>
<p class="i0">O Highness, Highness! wilt thou never</p>
<p class="i0">Be as wise as thou art mighty?”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
and herewith, and with a conjuration of soft dews and mists
convocated by Plutus to lay the flaming devils whom he had raised,
ends the spectacle and the scene.
</p>

<p>
What next? The fourth scene discovers the Emperor on his holy Roman
throne, as in the second. Faust hopes that his Majesty has readily
pardoned the frolic of flame-jugglery with which the preceding
day’s sport had ended; and the Emperor expresses his high delight
with the exhibition of such tricks; for nothing could give him
greater pleasure than to imagine himself for a season a king of
salamanders. Mephistopheles then comes forward with the finished
draught of his new scheme for the replenishing of the Imperial
exchequer; and, that his Majesty may not have long to wait for the
drudgery of the mattock and spade in bringing to light the hidden
treasures before promised, the affair is to be managed in the
meantime by paper money; and straightway, upon the faith of the
to-be-unearthed gold, the Minister of Finance is relieved from his
perplexities, and the whole country rises and swells and billows up
in a flux of prosperity. This as a prelude; but the serious work is
yet to come. The Emperor requests the great conjuror to produce for
his amusement something better than salamanders, and more wonderful
even than paper money. He wishes to see the famous beauty, the
Spartan Helen who set Troy on fire, and Paris the princely shepherd,
whose well-trimmed locks and gold-embroidered mantle had prevailed
to seduce her from her fidelity to her royal husband. Faust engages
to gratify the Imperial wishes; and Mephistopheles, after a little
demurring&mdash;the shades of the classical world being not within his
proper domain&mdash;consents. Whereupon the hero, holding in his hand a
magic key which he has received from his comrade, descends through
the earth into the empty and bodiless realm of the <span class="sc">Mothers</span>; and,
having abstracted from their presence a mystical tripod, ascends
into the upper air, and appears before the Imperial Court, where,
habited as a priest, he instantly invokes the shade of the famous
pair, to whom Aphrodite has been so lavish of her gifts. They
forthwith appear, and, environed by music and mist, exhibit their
classical charms, and repeat their storied loves to the modern eye.
The exhibition, of course, after the first surprise is over,
produces different effects on the spectators, according to their
different tastes; the Court critics, like other brethren of the same
carping fraternity, must have something to object, even to the queen
of beauties; but Faust is fascinated, and, at the first glance,
falls violently in love with the phantom which himself had raised.
As before the vanishing form which he had seen in the magic mirror,
when in the witches’ kitchen, so here again he stands transfixed
with wonder, gazes in ecstasy, glows with passion, and, losing all
sense of propriety, raves in jealous indignation at Paris, for
venturing to handle too familiarly the object of his adoration. He
then rushes insanely to seize the bodiless form; but no sooner has
fleshly touch troubled the spiritual essence than an explosion
follows. The Doctor falls down in a swoon; the fair apparitions
vanish; and Mephistopheles, taking the hero on his back, leaves the
scene of the luckless conjuration amid darkness and confusion. Thus
ends the first act.
</p>

<p>
The second act displays the old Gothic, high-vaulted, narrow chamber
which we remember to have seen in the first scene of the first act
of this strange drama. This chamber formerly belonged to Doctor
Faust; it now belongs to his hopeful disciple in the art of alchemy,
the learned Doctor Wagner, whom we at once recognise as an old
friend. To refresh old memories further, the same young student is
introduced, to whom Mephistopheles, masqued in academical cap and
gown, had given such admirable instructions on his first entrance to
college life. He is now no longer a freshman, but a Bachelor of
Arts, well crammed with the customary amount of book lore, notable,
also, for a certain heroic dash of scepticism, which has taught him
to believe that a large amount of what passes for learning in the
world is humbug, and that the professors of learning, generally, are
only a more respectable sort of quacks. He stands in no need now of
a Faust or a Mephistopheles to instruct him; for he knows more than
all the most learned doctors can teach him by the simple omnipotence
of his own conceit. He has studied theology under some neologic
doctor of the age, is a decided disbeliever in the personality of
the Devil, and boasts with the most confident faith in the
infallibility of his own <span class="sc">Ego</span>&mdash;“<i>Unless I will, no devil may
exist!</i>” But the principal character in this scene is the learned
Doctor Wagner himself, who is exhibited in his laboratory, bending
and blowing over the hot coals of his furnace in the act of making a
man. And anon, not so much by the chymick wit of Wagner, of course,
as by the magic of Mephistopheles, <span class="sc">Homunculus</span> does actually come
forth, all glowing and eager, enclosed within a glass phial, a brisk
little fellow, brimful of elastic energy, and fired with the heroic
resolve to be developed into the fulness of the freedom of the
perfect man, bursting his vitreous hull with all possible
expedition. To his chymick “fatherkin” Wagner he pays little or
no respect, but recognises Mephistopheles on the spot as first
cousin; in Faust, and the dreams of Spartan Helen that occupy his
fancy, being, like the Doctor, of a hot and amorous temperament, he
takes a wonderful interest; and, spurred on by that lust of
intellectual adventure which is characteristic of his nature, after
a few preliminary remarks, proposes to Mephistopheles that they
should all three set themselves afloat on the magic mantle, and
balloon over to Thessaly, where, amid the haunts of Erichtho and
other famous witches, an assembly of old classical ghosts and
goblins, heroes and heroines, is that night to be held. On this
phantasmal expedition the worthy triad accordingly set out without
delay; Homunculus to enlarge his mind and achieve development; Faust
to search out Helen; and Mephistopheles from mere curiosity; for, in
fact, he is quite a stranger in the classical Hades, and is not,
from anything that has come to his ear, inclined to imagine that
there is anything in Olympus which will suit his humour half so well
as the witches on the Brocken.
</p>

<p>
We are now prepared for what the poet has evidently dressed up with
special care, as the imposing spectacle of the second act, intending
to overpower the senses of the spectator with a profusion of
imaginative wealth, in the same fashion as he managed the Carnival
in the first act; with this slight difference, that, whereas there
we had a show of masqued realities, here we have a show of real
phantoms. To this phantasmal exhibition the poet gives the name of
the Classical Walpurgis-Night, or May-Day Night, the counterpart of
the Gothic Walpurgis-Night set forth with such power and variety in
the first part of the drama. Like the short intermezzo of Oberon and
Titania’s golden wedding on the Brocken, the strange motley dance
of figures that are here made to pop up before us with significant
saws in their mouths, have little or nothing to do with the main
action of the piece. Faust and Homunculus and Mephistopheles appear
at intervals merely flitting through its luxuriant variety like
fire-flies in a forest full of lions and tigers, and camelopards,
and every curious wild beast. The scene is in the Pharsalian
Plains&mdash;Thessaly being the native ground of classical witchcraft and
enchantment&mdash;the time of course midnight. The prologue is spoken by
Erichtho, Lucan’s famous witch, in Iambic trimeters which the poet
handles with the fine rhythmical tact so prominent in all his
productions. Immediately after her monologue the three magical
aeronauts appear; then colossal ants gathering gold grains; with
them gigantic griffins, keepers of the gold, and Arimaspi fighting
with the griffins for its possession; then Sphynxes, and Sirens, and
Stymphalides, and various, to the classical ear familiar, monsters
of the bird genus, who hold much talk, but not of much significance,
with Faust and his conductor. Suddenly the scene changes to the
banks of the Peneus, where the god of the classical flood sits
crowned with reeds, surrounded by gracefully sportive groups of
Nymphs, and majestically sailing swans. Thereafter a hollow tramp of
horses’ hoofs announces the arrival of the Centaur Chiron, wise
pedagogue of Achilles and other renowned classical heroes. Him Faust
accosts, and requests a clue to the haunt of the fair Helen, the
possession of whom still burns in his inordinate desire as the only
thing capable of making him happy. To this request the wise bi-form
demi-god is not able, from his own resources, to accede; but he
takes the Doctor on his back; and off they tramp together to the
temple-cave of Manto&mdash;the famous prophet-daughter of Æsculapius.
With her Faust enters the subterranean regions, the realm of
Persephone; and the possession of Helen, as we shall see in the
third act, is the reward of his intrepidity. But, though Faust seems
now amply provided for, the phantasmal hubbub goes on. The Sirens
and the Sphynxes again come to the front, singing and soliloquising
as before; likewise the ants and the griffins; and to them presently
are associated, Seismos (earthquake), the Pygmies or Lilliputians,
and the Idæan Dactyles or Tom Thumbs of antiquity; with them&mdash;in
honour of Schiller, we may suppose&mdash;the cranes of Ibycus; then
Empusa the foul ass-footed blood-sucking hag, and troops of hideous
Lamias to captivate the Gothic taste of Mephistopheles; but even
these are not ugly enough for him; so he wanders on through the
Fair, till he encounters the three daughters of Phorcys, who had
only one eye and one tooth among them; and from one of these he
borrows her hideous mask, that he may perform juggleries behind it
in a future part of the play. Meanwhile Homunculus, in prosecution
of his eager desire to be developed, has hunted out two
philosophers, Anaxagoras and Thales; and under the guidance of the
latter, he proceeds through the peopled air to the adjacent bays of
the Ægean Sea, where the marine gods and demi-gods are holding
their revels. To this water-festival the scene finally changes; and
forthwith a new swarm of vocal apparitions begins to buzz around us;
among whom (besides the Sirens, whom we had before) Nereus and
Proteus, the Telchins of Rhodes, the Cabiri of Samothrace, with
troops of shell-blowing Tritons, and Nereids riding on dolphins and
hippocampes, are the most remarkable. With these fair apparitions,
and the pleasant aquatic sports in which they are engaged,
Homunculus, under the appropriate teaching of Thales, the
water-philosopher, seems vastly delighted; and mounting on the
dolphin-back of Proteus, careers about from creek to creek, seeking
anxiously for a just occasion of being fully developed. This desired
consummation, accordingly, happens sooner perhaps than the little
man had fancied, and in an unexpected fashion; for, as he bounds
along from wave to wave gallantly, on the back of the multiform
sea-god, the lovely Galatea, the fairest of the daughters of Doris,
suddenly presents herself to his view, all radiant with marine
beauty, like a sea-Venus, drawn in a shell-car. To stand unmoved at
such a spectacle was not possible, as we may remember, even to
ponderous Polypheme in the Ovidian ballad, much less to a nimble and
highly excitable Homunculus. A commotion is immediately observed in
the waters close to Galatea’s car; the silver foam becomes red and
glowing; the spark of Homunculus dilates itself into a blaze; a
breaking of glass and a plashing of water is heard; and a bright
illumination spreads itself widely over the festal waves. Hereupon
breaks in full and symphonious the song of the Sirens.
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0q">“Hail to Ocean, silver plashing,</p>
<p class="i0">Hail to Fire around it flashing,</p>
<p class="i0">Hail to pure Air’s breezy pinions,</p>
<p class="i0">Hail to deep Earth’s dark dominions;</p>
<p class="i0">Blithely to the elements four,</p>
<p class="i0">Festal notes symphonious pour.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
And with this erotic explosion the Classical Walpurgis-Night ends,
and the third act of the drama commences. This third act is entirely
made up of another fanciful piece, exhibiting the phantasmal loves
of Faust and Helen. The famous Lacedæmonian beauty appears
surrounded by a chorus of Trojan captive maids in the palace of
Menelaus, at Sparta. Her husband, on the way back from the weary
capture of Troy, is still on the broad seas, Helen having been sent
before to prepare a sacrifice in honour of his expected arrival. For
this sacrifice everything had been prescribed by Menelaus, only not
the victim; and, while Helen is wondering with herself what might be
the cause of this omission, Mephistopheles suddenly appears in the
mask of one of the Phorcyades, and, giving himself out for the old
housekeeper of the palace, succeeds in filling the mind of Helen
with no unreasonable fears, that she is, in fact, herself the victim
destined by her death to atone for the decennial toils and troubles
of the Greeks before Ilium. From the imminent danger thus impending
there is no safety for the fair but to throw herself under the
guidance of Mephistopheles, into the arms of Faust, who, by his
accustomed magical machinery, has established himself in a grand
Gothic castle, hard by, among the ridges of Taygetus. No sooner is
this resolution taken, than the scene suddenly changes from a
classical palace a thousand years before Christ, to a Gothic castle
a thousand years after Christ, where, in the midst of knights and
squires, courtiers, cavaliers, and other appropriate
supernumeraries, marshalled plentifully around, the thaumaturgic
Doctor appears as a German prince of the Middle Ages, with dignity
and loyal regard, coming forward to pay his homage to the paragon of
classical beauty. After a few gallant speeches gracefully made and
gracefully responded to, Helen, of course, surrenders at discretion;
and the scene changes to a lovely Arcadian district, with wood and
water, mountain and mead, richly variegating the pastoral solitude,
the abode of love. What is there enacted you may guess partly, but
not altogether; you may well imagine that Faust and Helen are there
depicted as enjoying all the raptures that, to transcendental
lovers, in such a place, naturally belong; but you will not guess
that from their phantasmal embrace a son is born, and that this son,
under the name of Euphorion, is neither more nor less than
impersonated Poetry, the same, or a similar allegorial character,
that we were already introduced to in the first act, under the name
of the Boy-charioteer. Here, in this third act, he appears brisk and
nimble, tricksy as a Mercury, lovely as a Cupid, precocious,
impetuous, and elastic as a Chatterton. And, like a Chatterton, he
will not run and leap only in the fashion of common boys, but he
bounds and skips, right and left, above and below, without reason or
measure. Light and agile in every motion, more like a bird than a
boy, he is tempted to believe that the air, not the earth, is his
proper element, and, notwithstanding the importunate warnings of his
parents, assays, like Icarus, to bestride the air, and, like Icarus,
falls and perishes. This mournful catastrophe the poet gladly makes
use of to dissolve the spell of Helen’s phantasmal existence, and
to put a finale on the unsubstantial classical courtship of Doctor
Faust. The mother precipitates herself after the son, a second time
to find her home in the dim halls of Proserpine; and the hero, by
the direction of Mephistopheles, seizes the dropped mantle of Helen,
and, wrapping himself in it, is straightway enveloped in clouds and
borne aloft through far space, even back to honest Deutschland, in
quest of new adventures.
</p>

<p>
The fourth act is very short, merely a stepping-stone to the fifth,
it would appear. In the first scene Faust is exhibited in a new
character. Pleasures both real and fantastical having been
exhausted, he now girds his loins to work, and that neither in the
Moon nor in any extra-terrene sphere, but even on this sorry planet,
which his high-soaring spirit had so long despised:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0q">“No talk of moons! this earth for mighty deeds</p>
<p class="i0">Hath scope enough: the man who dares succeeds;</p>
<p class="i0">I’ve hatched a plan of manful stout adventure,</p>
<p class="i0">And with brave heart on bold career I enter!”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
This is a great improvement, no doubt; but, as Faust never does
anything to the end of his career without magic and the fellowship
of the Devil, the activity into which he immediately dashes has no
effect in exciting the admiration of the spectator. The Emperor, it
seems&mdash;the same with whom we made acquaintance in the first
act&mdash;notwithstanding the unexpected aid of hidden treasures and
paper money, being a lover of pleasure rather than of governing, has
fallen into discredit with his subjects; and a
counter-Kaiser&mdash;according to the not uncommon practice of Popes and
Kaisers in the Middle Ages&mdash;is set up. Faust, though he professes
himself no great admirer of the special sphere of activity which is
opened up by war, nevertheless, for the love he bears to the
Emperor, who is a good fellow with a thousand foibles, allows
himself to be persuaded by Mephistopheles to take part in the war
against the counter-Kaiser. This war, as was to be expected with
Mephistopheles behind scenes, is brought speedily to a glorious
conclusion, and that specially by the intervention of the three
mighty men of David (2 Sam. xxiii. 8), and a host of Undenes with
water juggleries, whom Mephistopheles calls to the rescue: and the
Doctor, like Bellerophon in Homer, is rewarded for his heroic
soldiership by an extensive grant of land along the sea-coast, great
part of which, however, has yet to be redeemed from the waves. So
ends act the fourth.
</p>

<p>
Act fifth exhibits our hero, now in extreme old age&mdash;exactly one
hundred years, we learn from Eckermann&mdash;after some seven or eight
decades of mortal life spent first in all sorts of vain speculation,
and then in all sorts of idle dissipation and lawless indulgence, at
length settled down as a landed proprietor, a great agricultural
improver, a redeemer of waste lands from the sea, a builder of
harbours, and a promoter of trade. But in the midst of engrossing
business and continued occupation, as much, at least, as axe and
spade, ditch and dyke can furnish him withal, he is the old man
still, discontented and unhappy. The lord of a vast tract of
sea-coast, and of uncounted acres, he is miserable, because an old
peasant and his old wife&mdash;Baucis and Philemon&mdash;are the owners of a
little cottage near his house, and a few lime trees, which deform
his lawn and obstruct his view. ’Tis the old story of Ahab, King
of Israel, and Naboth’s vineyard (1 Kings xxi.), as
Mephistopheles, who is well versed in Scripture, takes occasion to
inform us. Well, what is to be done? The attendant fiend of course
undertakes (like certain Highland proprietors whom we hear of) to
expel the good old people from their old dwelling; and Faust, like
the same Caledonian aristocracy, solaces his conscience with the
salve that he will provide the good people a far more valuable and
more convenient lodging in some remote corner of his estate.
Meanwhile Mephistopheles, not over scrupulous about means, and not
being able to persuade the stiff-necked and timid old snails to
creep out of their shell, settles the matter&mdash;as has been practised
also in the Scottish Highlands&mdash;by applying fire to habitation and
habitant at once; the pious old pair fall a sacrifice to the greed
of the master and the violence of the man; and with this blood on
his hands, Faustus now prepares, with all possible heroic
confidence, to meet death and to mount up to Heaven.
</p>

<p>
We are now arrived at the closing scene of this eventful history.
’Tis midnight: the scene is Faust’s castle; before the door of
his chamber four grey old hags appear. “I,” says the one, “am
called <span class="sc">Want</span>.” “I,” says the second, “<span class="sc">Guilt</span>.” “I,” says the
third, “<span class="sc">Care</span>.” “I,” quoth the fourth, “am called <span class="sc">Need</span>.” Of
these four, however, only one can do, or attempt to do, any harm
to the magical Doctor, for he is now a rich man; and rich men can
know nothing of Want or Need, nor of Guilt, either, we are told;
but Care leaps in through the keyhole, and annoys him a little
before his dismissal. The Doctor, however, is heroically determined
not to yield to this demon; and he finds his sure remedy for all
unpleasant cogitations in unremitted work. The great pioneers of
land improvement, canals and ditches, must be proceeded with; and
the indefatigable Doctor, even after pestilential Care had blown
a blinding blast into his eyes, marches into the grave with the
spade and the pick-axe in his hand. Then commences a scene of a
most singular character. The terrible jaws of Hell yawn wide on
the left side of the stage, and a contest commences between
Mephistopheles on the one hand, and the descending angels on the
other, for the possession of the soul of Faust. At first the Evil
Spirit seems confident of success, strengthened as he is by a
numerous host of multiform imps and devils, who come up in swarms
from the steaming mouth of the abyss; but the fury of this
malignant host is soon disarmed in a very simple way, by a band of
young blooming boy-angels scattering a shower of celestial blossoms
over the heads of the infernals. Beneath the fire of these
apparently innocent weapons, the legion of horned, and dumpy, and
wizened devils fall head foremost into the pit whence they had
issued; while their mighty master, Mephistopheles, stands so
captivated by the bright bloom and the pretty looks of the rosy
cherubs, that in the very moment when heroism is most necessary, he
loses all his manhood, and a few beardless boys, with psalms and
flosculosities, cheat him of the immortal soul which was his by the
signature of blood, and by the seal of a lifetime spent in giving
free rein to all sorts of foolish fancies and unprincipled
iniquities.
</p>

<p>
After this catastrophe there remains nothing but the formal
introduction of Faust to Heaven, for which the closing scene is
appropriated. The Virgin Mary, surrounded by pious Anchorites and
fair Penitents, with Fathers seraphic and ecstatic, is revealed in
the heavenly glory, awaiting the arrival of redeemed souls from
earth; and immediately the band of angels that had worsted
Mephistopheles appear aloft in triumph, bearing the immortal part of
Faust, and singing a hymn, the words of which are intended to convey
the moral of the piece:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0q">“<i>A rescued spirit to the goal</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>We bring of Earth’s probation;</i></p>
<p class="i0"><span class="sc">The ever-active striving soul</span></p>
<p class="i0"><span class="sc">Works out its own salvation</span>.</p>
<p class="i0"><i>And when, in love and mercy strong,</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>His God and Saviour meets him,</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>The angel-choir, to join their throng,</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>With hearty welcome greets him</i>.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">
Among the throng of redeemed Penitents one appears conspicuous,
whose name, while she lived on earth, was Margaret; she is close by
the Virgin, interceding for Faust, and ever as she mounts with the
Queen of Heaven to higher stages of glory, draws the newcomer after
her to share in her sempiternal blessedness. The curtain then falls;
the redeemed throngs ascend; and the scene resounds with the
mystical chorus:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="quote_o"><div class="quote_i">
<p class="i0q"><i>“Earth and earthly things</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Type the celestial,</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Shadow and shorn</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Is all glory terrestrial;</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Beauty immortal</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>The rapt spirit hails,</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Where the eternally-</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Female prevails.”</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>
After so detailed an account of this rich and various exhibition of
imaginative power, the student of this great world-drama, to use a
German phrase, can have no difficulty in understanding the theology
and the theodicy of the great Teutonic poet. The promise of the
Prologue in Heaven is fulfilled; there is no such thing as
everlasting punishment; and the Evil Spirit is sure to be cheated
even of the souls for whom he has most surely bargained, if that
soul, after staining itself with any number of sins, only perseveres
at last in some course of honourable and useful activity. This is
not according to the common Protestant conception in such cases; for
Protestantism, having abolished Purgatory, lies under a necessity of
peopling Tartarus more largely; and besides, after such a solemn
compact with the Evil One, and twenty-four years (for that is the
number given in the legend) spent in unrepented indulgence of all
sensualities and vanities, it was dramatically as well as
theologically inconsistent to redeem such a deliberate and
persistent sinner from the damnation for which he had bargained. But
the hell of the mediæval Catholic Church, though terrible enough in
its pictorial presentation (as many an Italian cloister testifies)
was more accommodating in its adaptation to the many forms of human
weakness; and so, to magnify the grace of God, and make Christ all
in all, after a fashion which the severe Protestant Calvinist is
forced to condemn, the mediæval form of the Faust legend could
afford to save Faust, notwithstanding his blood-sealed transaction
with the Devil; and no one has a right to blame Goethe, morally and
theologically, for having adopted this view of the matter. But,
though the salvation of Faust, according to the feeling of orthodox
mediæval Christianity, is permissible, and even desirable, the
manner in which, and the process by which, his salvation is achieved
by the German Protestant poet differs very much from the treatment
it receives at the hand of the Catholic Church. In Christian
theology&mdash;and in any healthy system of human Ethics too, I
imagine&mdash;the forgiveness of a great sinner always implies confession
of guilt, and a process, sometimes painful and protracted, of
repentance and amendment; but of this not a hint occurs in the
second part of Faust; and so the moral instincts of man, which had
been so strongly appealed to in the first part, are ignored, with a
feeling of great moral dissatisfaction as the unavoidable result. So
much for the ethico-theological aspect of the case. Æsthetically,
and viewed as a dramatic continuation of the first part, the second
part of the poem is much more at fault, and must be pronounced, with
all its wealth of imaginative reproduction, and all its luxuriance
of rhythmical form, a magnificent failure. If this judgment appears
severe, it must be remembered that the very excellence of the first
part, considered morally and dramatically, rendered a satisfactory
continuation of it, even to the genius of a Goethe, both impolitic
and impossible. Who would ever dream of a continuation of Hamlet?
Had it pleased our great dramatic master to keep Hamlet alive amid
the general catastrophe of the play, as he might lightly have done,
the future fate of his hero would only have been a matter of
historical curiosity. For dramatic purposes his course was finished.
So with Faust. Though he remains on the stage in the pathetic
closing scene, dramatically his part is played out. The “<span class="sc">Hither
to me!</span>” of his fiendish companion is quite enough for the
satisfaction of the moral feeling which the catastrophe has excited;
all beyond this is a matter, no doubt, for metaphysical speculation
and theological solution, but with which the dramatist has nothing
to do. But even if there were any feeling in the breast of the
spectator, causing him to look for some terrestrial continuation of
the sad story which he has been witnessing, by the manner in which
he has conducted this continuation the poet has altogether cut
himself off from the moral sympathy which so spontaneously flowed as
a tribute to his art in the first part. The history of Faust and
Margaret, notwithstanding the magical or diabolic background on
which it figures, is a simple story of flesh and blood, a story
which would remain equally true and equally affecting were the demon
and the witches removed altogether from the scene. But now, in this
second part, we are charmed by the wand of the fiendish harlequin
into a region of mere fancy and phantasmagoria, into a swarming
Fair, so to speak, of multitudinous phantasmal figures, through the
midst of which the real actors flit to and fro like a few idle
civilians amid the ordered files and motley groups of some gigantic
host. The primary here is buried in the secondary; the actors are
lost in their environment; and the real throughout, in a most unreal
fashion, confounded with the ideal. Faust, of course, and
Mephistopheles, and even Wagner, peering with glittering eye through
the smoke of his alchymical kitchen, are the same creatures of flesh
and blood that we were made acquainted with in part one; only all
perhaps a little enfeebled in character; Mephistopheles a little
more of the conjuror, and a little less of the Devil; Faust much
less of a thinker, and not a whit less of a sensualist; Wagner much
less modest, and much more besotted in the disnatured studies and
fanciful operations of his chemical kitchen. All this is real. But
this real Faust becomes enamoured of a phantom Helen; and of this
monstrous embrace an ideal poetic child, incarnating, we presume,
the contrary beauties of the Classical and the Romantic schools, is
the product. Of such a strange jumble we may say truly, as Jeffrey
said falsely of Wordsworth’s “Excursion,” “<i>This will never
do</i>.” Such a violation of all the principles of common sense and
of good taste cannot be pardoned even to Goethe. The faults of men
of genius, it has been said, are the consolation of the dunces; but
whether the dunces choose to console themselves in this way or not,
the fact is certain, that on the stern battlefield of public life,
and no less in the flowery realms of imaginative construction, a
great genius is precisely the man to make occasionally a great
blunder. There maybe some few great things, and some wonderful
things, and not a few wise things (as who could expect otherwise
from Goethe) in the second part of Faust; but it is certainly
neither a great drama nor the just sequence of a great drama. I am
inclined to compare it with the rich fanciful work familiar to the
students of art, in the so-called <i>Loggie</i>, or galleries of Raphael,
in the Vatican. In the first part of Faust, Goethe is a great
dramatist; in the second part he is an arabesque painter. It is no
small matter to compose poetical arabesques, as our poet has done so
luxuriantly in the Classical Walpurgis Night, and other parts of
this piece; and a very natural affair, too, one may remark, in the
circumstances of the present composition. It is rare, perhaps
impossible, in the history of literary manifestation, that a poet
should commence a great poem in the fervour of youth, continue it
through the firmness of middle life, and finish it in the serenity
of an advanced old age, with a homogeneousness of inspiration, and a
perfectly consistent handling throughout. Goethe, in particular, was
a man who grew, as he advanced, into many new shapes, and, of
course, grew out of the old ones; and, though he was to the end a
consummate artist, and there was no question of decayed powers, much
less of dotage, in the grand old octogenarian, it was an artistic
blunder in him to weave the fantastic tissue of fair forms, which
amused his later years, into a common web with the tale of strong
human passion, which had grown into a well-rounded dramatic shape
under the influence of his most fervid youthful inspirations. The
error lay in the name and the connection perhaps more than in the
matter. A classical Walpurgis Night, or a love adventure with a
resuscitated Helen of Troy, might have formed a very pleasing
exhibition as a masque or show for an academical celebration&mdash;as at
Oxford, for instance, in Commemoration season&mdash;while, as a second
part of Faust, it falls flat. Let it contain as many allegories as
the wise old poet-philosopher may have meant to smuggle into it, and
as many mysteries as the mystery-loving race of German commentators
may have strained themselves to draw out of it; as it stands, and
where it stands, and with the claims which it necessarily makes, it
remains a brilliant blunder and a magnificent mistake; and with this
we must be content. Those whose organ of reverence is stronger than
their love of truth, will, of course, think otherwise; and this is
no doubt the most suitable excuse for any nonsense that may have
been thought or written on the subject; but, if it be a part of the
wisdom of life to learn to look calmly on plain facts, even when
most disagreeable, it belongs no less to an educated literary
judgment to admit honestly the special shortcomings of a great
genius, without prejudice to his general merits. An ignorant worship
is a poor substitute for a just appreciation.

<p class="i0">The right of man, which Nature’s gift imparts,</p>

<p class="i0">What gives him power to move all hearts,</p>
<p class="i0">Each stubborn element to sway,</p>
<p class="i0">What but the harmony, his being’s inmost tone,</p>
<p class="i0">That charms all feelings back into his own?</p>
<p class="i0">Where listless Nature, her eternal thread,</p>
<p class="i0">The unwilling spindle twists around,</p>
<p class="i0">And hostile shocks of things that will not wed</p>
<p class="i0">With jarring dissonance resound,</p>
<p class="i0">Who guides with living pulse the rhythmic flow</p>
<p class="i0">Of powers that make sweet music as they go?</p>
<p class="i0">Who consecrates each separate limb and soul</p>

<p class="i0">Who makes the surgy-swelling billow</p>
<p class="i0">Heave with the wildly heaving breast,</p>
<p class="i0">And on the evening’s rosy pillow,</p>
<p class="i0">Invites the brooding heart to rest?</p>
<p class="i0">Who scatters spring’s most lovely blooms upon</p>
<p class="i0">The path of the belovèd one?</p>
<p class="i0">Who plaits the leaves that unregarded grow</p>
<p class="i0">Into a crown to deck the honored brow?</p>

<p class="i0">They meet by chance, are pleased, and stay</p>
<p class="i0">On being pressed, just for a day;</p>
<p class="i0">Then hours to hours are sweetly linked in chain,</p>
<p class="i0">Till net-caught by degrees, they find retreat is vain.</p>
<p class="i0">At first the sky is bright, then darkly lowers;</p>
<p class="i0">To-day, fine thrilling rapture wings the hours,</p>
<p class="i0">To-morrow, doubts and anguish have their chance,</p>
<p class="i0">And, ere one knows, they’re deep in a romance.</p>
<p class="i0">A play like this both praise and profit brings.</p>
<p class="i0">Plunge yourself boldly in the stream of things&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">What’s lived by all, but known to few&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">And bring up something fresh and new,</p>
<p class="i0">No matter what; just use your eyes,</p>
<p class="i0">And all will praise what all can prize;</p>
<p class="i0">Strange motley pictures in a misty mirror,</p>
<p class="i0">A spark of truth in a thick cloud of error;</p>
<p class="i0">’Tis thus we brew the genuine beverage,</p>
<p class="i0">To edify and to refresh the age.</p>
<p class="i0">The bloom of youth in eager expectation,</p>
<p class="i0">With gaping ears drinks in your revelation;</p>
<p class="i0">Each tender sentimental disposition</p>
<p class="i0">Sucks from your art sweet woe-be-gone nutrition;</p>
<p class="i0">Each hears a part of what his own heart says,</p>
<p class="i0">While over all your quickening sceptre sways.</p>
<p class="i0">These younglings follow where you bid them go.</p>
<p class="i0">Lightly to laughter stirred, or turned to woe,</p>
<p class="i0">They love the show, and with an easy swing,</p>
<p class="i0">Follow the lordly wafture of your wing;</p>

<p class="i0">Of thronging songs within me flowing!</p>
<p class="i0">Then slept the world in misty blue,</p>
<p class="i0">Each bud the nascent wonder cherished,</p>
<p class="i0">And all for me the flowerets grew,</p>
<p class="i0">That on each meadow richly flourished.</p>
<p class="i0">Though I had nothing then, I had a treasure,</p>
<p class="i0">The thirst for truth, and in illusion pleasure.</p>
<p class="i0">Give me the free, unshackled pinion,</p>
<p class="i0">The height of joy, the depth of pain,</p>
<p class="i0">Strong hate, and stronger love’s dominion;</p>
<p class="i0">O give me back my youth again!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Merryfellow.</span></p>
<p class="i0">The fire of youth, good friend, you need, of course,</p>
<p class="i0">Into the hostile ranks to break,</p>
<p class="i0">Or, when the loveliest damsels hang by force,</p>
<p class="i0">With amorous clinging, from your neck,</p>
<p class="i0">When swift your wingèd steps advance</p>
<p class="i0">To where the racer’s prize invites you,</p>
<p class="i0">Or, after hours of whirling dance,</p>
<p class="i0">The nightly deep carouse invites you.</p>
<p class="i0">But to awake the well-known lyre</p>
<p class="i0">With graceful touch that tempers fire,</p>
<p class="i0">And to a self-appointed goal,</p>
<p class="i0">With tuneful rambling on to roll,</p>
<p class="i0">Such are your duties, aged sirs; nor we</p>
<p class="i0">Less honor pay for this, nor stint your fee;</p>

<p class="i0">We might have made some good beginning.</p>
<p class="i0">What stuff you talk of being in the vein!</p>
<p class="i0">A lazy man is never in the vein.</p>
<p class="i0">If once your names are on the poet’s roll,</p>

<p class="i0">Then brew the brews without delay;</p>
<p class="i0">What was not done to-day, to-morrow</p>
<p class="i0">Will leave undone for greater sorrow.</p>
<p class="i0">Don’t stand, and stare, and block the way,</p>
<p class="i0">But with a firm, set purpose lay</p>
<p class="i0">Hold of your bright thoughts as they rise to view,</p>
<p class="i5">And bid them stay;</p>
<p class="i0">Once caught, they will not lightly run away,</p>
<p class="i0">Till they have done what in them lies to do.</p>

<p class="i0">As much as when you shaped him from the dust.</p>
<p class="i0">Perhaps a little better he had thriven,</p>
<p class="i0">Had he not got the show of glimmering light from heaven:</p>
<p class="i0">He calls it reason, and it makes him free</p>

<p class="i0">A restless fever drives him to the waste.</p>
<p class="i0">Himself half seems to understand</p>

<p class="i0">From heaven he asks each loveliest star,</p>
<p class="i0">Earth’s chiefest joy must jump to his demand,</p>

<p class="i0">Into perdition down with thee;</p>
<p class="i0">But stand ashamed at last, when thou shalt see</p>
<p class="i0">An honest man, ’mid all his strivings dark,</p>

<p class="i0">Loud blast of trump shall blaze my glory;</p>

<p class="i0">Your pardon, sir, I heard your voice declaiming,</p>
<p class="i0">No doubt some old Greek drama, and I came in,</p>
<p class="i0">To profit by your learned recitation;</p>
<p class="i0">For in these days the art of declamation</p>
<p class="i0">Is held in highest estimation;</p>
<p class="i0">And I have heard asserted that a preacher</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Yes; when our parsons preach to make grimaces,</p>

<p class="i0">Alack! when a poor wight is so confined</p>

<p class="i0">What you don’t feel, you’ll hunt to find in vain.</p>
<p class="i0">It must gush from the soul, possess the brain,</p>
<p class="i0">And with an instinct kindly force compel</p>
<p class="i0">All captive hearts to own the grateful spell;</p>
<p class="i0">Go to! sit o’er your books, and snip and glue</p>
<p class="i0">Your wretched piece-work, dressing your ragout</p>
<p class="i0">From others’ feasts, your piteous flames still blowing</p>
<p class="i0">From sparks beneath dull heaps of ashes glowing;</p>

<p class="i0">If with such paltry meed content thou art;</p>

<p class="i0">The trim orations your fine speaker weaves,</p>

<p class="i2">To re-create may well the wise engage;</p>
<p class="i0">To know the choicest thoughts of every ancient sage,</p>
<p class="i0">And think how far above their best we’ve mounted high!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i3">O yes, I trow, even to the stars, so high!</p>
<p class="i2">My friend, the ages that are past</p>
<p class="i2">Are as a book with seven seals made fast;</p>
<p class="i2">And what men call the spirit of the age,</p>

<p class="i2">Who glass their own thoughts in the pliant page,</p>
<p class="i2">And image back themselves. O, then,</p>
<p class="i0">What precious stuff they dish, and call’t a book,</p>
<p class="i0">Your stomach turns at the first look;</p>
<p class="i0">A heap of rubbish, and a lumber room,</p>
<p class="i0">At best some great state farce with proclamations,</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Wagner.</span></p>
<p class="i0">But then the world!&mdash;the human heart and mind!</p>
<p class="i0">Somewhat of this to know are all inclined.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Yes! as such knowledge goes! but what man dares</p>
<p class="i0">To call the child by the true name it bears?</p>
<p class="i0">The noble few that something better knew,</p>
<p class="i0">And to the gross reach of the general view,</p>
<p class="i0">Their finer feelings bared, and insight true,</p>
<p class="i0">From oldest times were burnt and crucified.</p>
<p class="i0">I do beseech thee, friend&mdash;’tis getting late,</p>
<p class="i0">’Twere wise to put an end to our debate.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Wagner.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Such learned talk to draw through all the night</p>
<p class="i0">With Doctor Faust were my supreme delight;</p>
<p class="i0">But on the morrow, being Easter, I</p>
<p class="i0">Your patience with some questions more may try.</p>

<p class="i0">The godlike essence of our heaven-born powers</p>

<p class="i0">Soon as the good things of this world are ours,</p>
<p class="i0">We deem our nobler self a vain illusion,</p>
<p class="i0">And heaven-born instincts&mdash;very life of life&mdash;</p>

<p class="i0">Young fancy, that once soared with flight sublime,</p>

<p class="i0">Our fair-faced pleasures perish one by one.</p>
<p class="i0">Care nestles deep in every heart,</p>
<p class="i0">And, cradling there the secret smart,</p>
<p class="i0">Rocks to and fro, and peace and joy are gone.</p>
<p class="i0">What though new masks she still may wear,</p>
<p class="i0">Wealth, house and hall, with acres rich and rare,</p>
<p class="i0">As wife or child appear she, water, flame,</p>

<p class="i0">Yet in each breast ’tis deeply graven,</p>
<p class="i0">Upward and onward still to pant,</p>
<p class="i0">When over us, lost in the blue of heaven,</p>
<p class="i0">Her quavering song the lark doth chaunt;</p>
<p class="i0">When over piny peaks sublime</p>
<p class="i0">The eagle soars with easy strain,</p>

<p class="i0">Steers homeward to a sunnier clime.</p>

<p class="i0">I too have had my hours of whim,</p>
<p class="i0">But feeling here runs over reason’s brim.</p>
<p class="i0">Forest and field soon tire the eye to scan,</p>
<p class="i0">And eagle’s wings were never made for man.</p>
<p class="i0">How otherwise the mind and its delights!</p>
<p class="i0">From book to book, from page to page, we go.</p>
<p class="i0">Thus sweeten we the dreary winter nights,</p>
<p class="i0">Till every limb with new life is aglow;</p>
<p class="i0">And chance we but unroll some rare old parchment scroll,</p>
<p class="i0">All heaven stoops down, and finds a lodgment in the soul.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Thou know’st but the one impulse&mdash;it is well!</p>
<p class="i0">Tempt not the yearning that divides the heart.</p>
<p class="i0">Two souls, alas! within my bosom dwell!</p>
<p class="i0">This strives from that with adverse strain to part.</p>
<p class="i0">The one, bound fast by stubborn might of love,</p>
<p class="i0">To this low earth with grappling organs clings;</p>
<p class="i0">The other spurns the clod, and soars on wings</p>
<p class="i0">To join a nobler ancestry above.</p>
<p class="i0">Oh! be there spirits in the air,</p>
<p class="i0">’Twixt earth and heaven that float with potent sway,</p>
<p class="i0">Drop from your sphere of golden-glowing day,</p>
<p class="i0">And waft me hence new varied life to share!</p>
<p class="i0">Might I but own a mantle’s fold enchanted,</p>
<p class="i0">To climes remote to bear me on its wing,</p>
<p class="i0">More than the costliest raiment I should vaunt it,</p>
<p class="i0">More than the purple robe that clothes a king.</p>

<p class="i0">Invoke not rash the well-known spirit-throng,</p>
<p class="i0">That stream unseen the atmosphere along,</p>

<p class="i0">Weak men from every quarter to ensnare.</p>
<p class="i0">From the keen north in troops they float,</p>
<p class="i0">With sharpest teeth and arrow-pointed tongues;</p>
<p class="i0">From the harsh east they bring a blasting drought,</p>
<p class="i0">And feed with wasting greed upon thy lungs.</p>
<p class="i0">When from the arid south their sultry powers</p>
<p class="i0">They send, hot fires upheaping on thy crown,</p>
<p class="i0">The West brings forth his swarms with cooling showers,</p>
<p class="i0">To end in floods that sweep thy harvests down.</p>
<p class="i0">Quick-ear’d are they, on wanton mischief bent,</p>
<p class="i0">And work our will with surer bait to ply us;</p>
<p class="i0">They show as fair as heaven’s own couriers sent,</p>
<p class="i0">And lisp like angels when they most belie us.</p>
<p class="i0">But let us hence! the air is chill,</p>
<p class="i0">The cold gray mists are creeping down the hill,</p>
<p class="i0">Now is the time to seek the bright fireside.</p>
<p class="i0">Why standest thou with strange eyes opened wide?</p>
<p class="i0">What twilight-spectre may thy fancy trouble?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">See’st thou that swarthy dog sweeping through corn and stubble?</p>

<p class="i0">I saw him long ago&mdash;not strange he seemed to me.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Look at him well&mdash;what should the creature be?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Wagner.</span></p>
<p class="i0">He seems a poodle who employs his snout</p>
<p class="i0">Now here, now there, to snuff his master out.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Dost thou not see how nigher still and nigher</p>
<p class="i0">His spiral circles round us wind?</p>
<p class="i0">And, err I not, he leaves behind</p>
<p class="i0">His track a train of sparkling fire.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Wagner.</span></p>

<p class="i0">Methinks soft magic circles winds he,</p>
<p class="i0">About, about, a snare for thee and me.</p>

<p class="i0">I see him only doubtful springing round,</p>
<p class="i0">Having two strangers for his master found.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">He draws him closer&mdash;now he comes quite near!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Wagner.</span></p>
<p class="i0">A dog, be sure, and not a ghost, is here.</p>
<p class="i0">He growls, and looks about in fear,</p>
<p class="i0">And crouches down, and looks to you,</p>
<p class="i0">And wags his tail&mdash;what any dog will do.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Come hither, poodle!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Wagner.</span></p>
<p class="i9">’Tis a drollish brute;</p>
<p class="i0">When you stand still, then stands he mute,</p>
<p class="i0">But when you speak, he springs as he would speak to you;</p>
<p class="i0">He will bring back what you let fall,</p>
<p class="i0">And fetch your stick out of the water.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">You are quite right. There’s no such matter.</p>
<p class="i0">No trace of ghost&mdash;a dog well trained, that’s all!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Wagner.</span></p>
<p class="i0">A well-trained dog may well engage</p>
<p class="i0">The favor of a man most sage;</p>
<p class="i0">This poodle well deserves your recognition;</p>
<p class="i0">Few students learn so much from good tuition.</p>

<p class="i0">Cease, poodle! why snuff’st and snifflest thou so,</p>
<p class="i0">Running restless to and fro?</p>
<p class="i0">Behind the stove there lie at rest,</p>
<p class="i0">And take for bed my cushion the best!</p>
<p class="i0">And as without, on our mountain-ramble,</p>
<p class="i0">We joyed to see thy freakish gambol,</p>
<p class="i0">So here, my hospitable care,</p>
<p class="i0">A quiet guest, and welcome share.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p class="i2">When in our narrow cell confined,</p>
<p class="i2">The friendly lamp begins to burn,</p>
<p class="i2">Then clearer sees the thoughtful mind,</p>
<p class="i2">With searching looks that inward turn.</p>
<p class="i2">Bright Hope again within us beams,</p>
<p class="i2">And Reason’s voice again is strong,</p>
<p class="i2">We thirst for life’s untroubled streams,</p>
<p class="i2">For the pure fount of life we long.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p class="i0">Quiet thee, poodle! it seems not well</p>
<p class="i0">To break, with thy growling, the holy spell</p>
<p class="i0">Of my soul’s music, that refuses</p>
<p class="i0">All fellowship with bestial uses.</p>
<p class="i0">Full well we know that the human brood,</p>
<p class="i0">What they don’t understand condemn,</p>
<p class="i0">And murmur in their peevish mood</p>
<p class="i0">At things too fair and good for them;</p>

<p class="i0">That mocks my lips? so often why</p>
<p class="i0">Drink pleasure’s shallow fount, when scarce yet tasted, dry?</p>

<p class="i0">Which nowhere worthier or purer burns,</p>
<p class="i0">Than here in our New Testament.</p>
<p class="i0">I feel strange impulse in my soul</p>
<p class="i0">The sacred volume to unroll,</p>

<p class="i0">Lamed in the start of my career.</p>
<p class="i0">The naked word I dare not prize so high,</p>

<p class="i2">Am I awake, or bound with a spell?</p>
<p class="i2">How wondrously the brute doth swell!</p>
<p class="i2">Long and broad</p>
<p class="i2">Uprises he,</p>
<p class="i2">In a form that no form</p>
<p class="i2">Of a dog may be!</p>
<p class="i2">What spectre brought I into the house?</p>
<p class="i2">He stands already, with glaring eyes,</p>

<p class="i0">When with the graduates you dine to-day.</p>

<p class="i0">A writing, pedant!&mdash;hast thou never found</p>
<p class="i0">A man whose word was better than his bond?</p>
<p class="i0">Is’t not enough that by my spoken word,</p>
<p class="i0">Of all I am and shall be thou art lord?</p>
<p class="i0">The world drives on, wild wave engulfing wave,</p>
<p class="i0">And shall a line bind me, if I would be a knave?</p>
<p class="i0">Yet ’tis a whim deep-graven in the heart,</p>
<p class="i0">And from such fancies who would gladly part?</p>
<p class="i0">Happy within whose honest breast concealed</p>
<p class="i0">There lives a faith, nor time nor chance can shake;</p>
<p class="i0">Yet still a parchment, written, stamped, and sealed,</p>
<p class="i0">A spectre is before which all must quake.</p>
<p class="i0">Commit but once thy word to the goose-feather,</p>
<p class="i0">Then must thou yield the sway to wax and leather.</p>
<p class="i0">Say, devil&mdash;paper, parchment, stone, or brass?</p>
<p class="i0">With me this coin or that will pass;</p>
<p class="i0">Style, or chisel, or pen shall it be?</p>
<p class="i0">Thou hast thy choice of all the three.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">What need of such a hasty flare</p>
<p class="i0">Of words about so paltry an affair?</p>
<p class="i0">Paper or parchment, any scrap will do,</p>
<p class="i0">Then write in blood your signature thereto.</p>

<p class="i0">Too high hath soared my blown ambition;</p>
<p class="i0">I now take rank with thy condition;</p>
<p class="i0">The Mighty Spirit of All hath scorned me,</p>

<p class="i0">In magic veil, from unseen hand,</p>
<p class="i0">Be wonders ever at our command!</p>
<p class="i0">Plunge we into the rush of Time!</p>
<p class="i0">Into Action’s rolling main!</p>
<p class="i0">Then let pleasure and pain,</p>
<p class="i0">Loss and gain,</p>
<p class="i0">Joy and sorrow, alternate chime!</p>
<p class="i0">Let bright suns shine, or dark clouds lower,</p>

<p class="i0">Only have courage, friend, and be not shy!</p>

<p class="i0">Content from thee thy proper wares to buy,</p>

<p class="i6">There you are right!</p>
<p class="i0">One thing alone gives me concern,</p>
<p class="i0">The time is short, and we have much to learn.</p>
<p class="i0">There is a way, if you would know it,</p>
<p class="i0">Just take into your pay a poet;</p>
<p class="i0">Then let the learned gentleman sweep</p>
<p class="i0">Through the wide realms of imagination</p>
<p class="i0">And every noble qualification,</p>
<p class="i0">Upon your honored crown upheap,</p>
<p class="i0">The strength of the lion,</p>
<p class="i0">The wild deer’s agility,</p>
<p class="i0">The fire of the south,</p>
<p class="i0">With the north’s durability.</p>
<p class="i0">Then let his invention the secret unfold,</p>
<p class="i0">To be crafty and cunning, yet generous and bold;</p>
<p class="i0">And teach your youthful blood, as poets can,</p>
<p class="i0">To fall in love according to a plan.</p>
<p class="i0">Myself have a shrewd notion where we might</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>
<p class="i0">What am I then, if still I strive in vain</p>

<p class="i0">I feel it well, in vain have I uphoarded</p>

<p class="i0">My worthy friend, these things you view,</p>

<p class="i0">Some wiser method we must shape us,</p>
<p class="i0">Ere the joys of life escape us.</p>
<p class="i0">Why, what the devil! hands and feet,</p>
<p class="i0">Brain and brawn and blood are thine;</p>
<p class="i0">And what I drink, and what I eat,</p>
<p class="i0">Whose can it be, if ’tis not mine?</p>
<p class="i0">If I can number twice three horses,</p>
<p class="i0">Are not their muscles mine? and when I’m mounted,</p>
<p class="i0">I feel myself a man, and wheel my courses,</p>
<p class="i0">Just as if four-and-twenty legs I counted.</p>
<p class="i0">Quick then! have done with reverie,</p>
<p class="i0">And dash into the world with me!</p>
<p class="i0">I tell thee plain, a speculating fellow</p>
<p class="i0">Is like an ox on heath all brown and yellow,</p>
<p class="i0">Led in a circle by an evil spirit,</p>
<p class="i0">With roods of lush green pasture smiling near it.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Faust.</span></p>

<p class="i0">Besides, into the best of all your knowledge,</p>
<p class="i0">You know ’tis not permitted you to launch</p>

<p class="i0">Poor boy! he’s waited long, nor must depart</p>
<p class="i0">Without some friendly word for head and heart;</p>
<p class="i0">Come, let me slip into your gown; the mask</p>
<p class="i0">Will suit me well; as for the teaching task,</p>
<p class="i0">[<i>He puts on</i> <span class="sc">Faust’s</span> <i>scholastic robes.</i>]</p>

<p class="i0">To him hath Fate a spirit given,</p>
<p class="i0">With reinless impulse ever forwards driven,</p>
<p class="i0">Whose hasty striving overskips</p>
<p class="i0">The joys that flow for mortal lips;</p>
<p class="i0">Him drag I on through life’s wild chase,</p>
<p class="i0">Through flat unmeaning emptiness;</p>
<p class="i0">He shall cling and cleave to me,</p>
<p class="i0">Like a sprawling child in agony,</p>
<p class="i0">And food and drink, illusive hovering nigh,</p>
<p class="i0">Shall shun his parchèd lips, and cheat his longing eye;</p>
<p class="i0">He shall pine and pant and strain</p>

<i>Enter a</i> <span class="sc">Student</span>.
</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">I am but fresh arrived to-day,</p>
<p class="i0">And come my best respects to pay,</p>
<p class="i0">To one whose name, from boor to Kaiser,</p>
<p class="i0">None, without veneration, mention.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">I feel obliged by your attention!</p>
<p class="i0">You see a man than other men no wiser:</p>
<p class="i0">Have you made inquiry elsewhere?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Beseech you, sir, be my adviser!</p>
<p class="i0">I come with money to spend and spare,</p>
<p class="i0">With fresh young blood, and a merry heart,</p>
<p class="i0">On my college career to start:</p>
<p class="i0">My mother sent me, not without a tear,</p>
<p class="i0">To get some needful schooling here.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">A better place you could not find.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">To speak the truth, ’tis not much to my mind.</p>
<p class="i0">Within these narrow cloister walls,</p>
<p class="i0">These antiquated Gothic halls,</p>
<p class="i0">I feel myself but ill at ease;</p>
<p class="i0">No spot of green I see, no trees,</p>
<p class="i0">And ’mid your formal rows of benches,</p>
<p class="i0">I almost seem to lose my senses.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">That all depends on custom. Don’t you see</p>
<p class="i0">How a young babe at first is slow</p>
<p class="i0">To know its mother’s breast; but soon</p>
<p class="i0">With joy it strains the milky boon;</p>
<p class="i0">So you anon will suck nutrition</p>
<p class="i0">From Wisdom’s breasts with blest fruition.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">I yearn to do so even now;</p>
<p class="i0">But, in the first place, tell me how?</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">My help is yours, or great or small;</p>
<p class="i0">But choose your Faculty, first of all.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">I aim at culture, learning, all</p>
<p class="i0">That men call science on the ball</p>
<p class="i0">Of earth, or in the starry tent</p>
<p class="i0">Of heaven; all Nature high and low,</p>
<p class="i0">Broad and deep, I seek to know.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">There you are on the proper scent;</p>
<p class="i0">Only beware of too much distraction.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">With soul and body I’m girt for action,</p>
<p class="i0">And yet I cannot choose but praise</p>
<p class="i0">A little freedom and merriment,</p>
<p class="i0">On pleasant summer holidays.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Redeem the time, for fast it fleets away,</p>
<p class="i0">But order rules the hour it cannot stay.</p>
<p class="i0">Therefore ’tis plain that you must pass</p>
<p class="i0">First of all through the logic class.</p>
<p class="i0">There will your mind be postured rightly,</p>
<p class="i0">Laced up in Spanish buskins tightly,</p>
<p class="i0">That with caution and care, as wisdom ought,</p>
<p class="i0">It may creep along the path of thought,</p>
<p class="i0">And not with fitful flickering glow</p>
<p class="i0">Will o’ the wisp it to and fro.</p>
<p class="i0">There, too, if you hear the gentleman through</p>
<p class="i0">The term, to every lecture true,</p>
<p class="i0">You’ll learn that a stroke of human thinking,</p>
<p class="i0">Which you had practised once as free</p>
<p class="i0">And natural as eating and drinking,</p>
<p class="i0">Cannot be made without one! two! three!</p>
<p class="i0">True, it should seem that the tissue of thought</p>
<p class="i0">Is like a web by cunning master wrought,</p>
<p class="i0">Where one stroke moves a thousand threads,</p>
<p class="i0">The shuttle shoots backwards and forwards between,</p>
<p class="i0">The slender threads flow together unseen,</p>
<p class="i0">And one with the others thousand-fold weds:</p>
<p class="i0">Then steps the philosopher forth to show</p>
<p class="i0">How of necessity it must be so:</p>
<p class="i0">If the first be so, the second is so,</p>
<p class="i0">And therefore the third and the fourth is so;</p>
<p class="i0">And unless the first and the second before be,</p>
<p class="i0">The third and the fourth can never more be.</p>
<p class="i0">So schoolmen teach and scholars believe,</p>
<p class="i0">But none of them yet ever learned to weave.</p>
<p class="i0">He who strives to know a thing well</p>
<p class="i0">Must first the spirit within expel,</p>
<p class="i0">Then can he count the parts in his hand,</p>
<p class="i0">Only without the spiritual band.</p>
<p class="i0"><i>Encheiresis naturæ</i>, ’tis clept in Chemistry,</p>
<p class="i0">Thus laughing at herself, albeit she knows not why.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">I must confess I can’t quite comprehend you.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">In this respect time by and by will mend you,</p>
<p class="i0">When you have learned the crude mixed masses</p>
<p class="i0">To decompose, and rank them in their classes.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">I feel as stupid to all he has said,</p>
<p class="i0">As a mill-wheel were whirling round in my head.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">After logic, first of all,</p>
<p class="i0">To the study of metaphysics fall!</p>
<p class="i0">There strive to know what ne’er was made</p>
<p class="i0">To go into a human head;</p>
<p class="i0">For what is within and without its command</p>
<p class="i0">A high-sounding word is always at hand.</p>
<p class="i0">But chiefly, for the first half year,</p>
<p class="i0">Let order in all your studies appear;</p>
<p class="i0">Five lectures a-day, that no time be lost,</p>
<p class="i0">And with the clock be at your post!</p>
<p class="i0">Come not, as some, without preparation,</p>
<p class="i0">But con his paragraphs o’er and o’er,</p>
<p class="i0">To be able to say, when you hear his oration,</p>
<p class="i0">That he gives you his book, and nothing more;</p>
<p class="i0">Yet not the less take down his words in writing,</p>
<p class="i0">As if the Holy Spirit were inditing!</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">I shall not quickly give you cause</p>
<p class="i0">To repeat so weighty a clause;</p>
<p class="i0">For what with black on white is written,</p>
<p class="i0">We carry it home, a sure possession.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">But, as I said, you must choose a profession.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">With Law, I must confess, I never was much smitten.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">I should be loath to force your inclination,</p>
<p class="i0">Myself have some small skill in legislation;</p>
<p class="i0">For human laws and rights from sire to son,</p>
<p class="i0">Like an hereditary ill, flow on;</p>
<p class="i0">From generation dragged to generation,</p>
<p class="i0">And creeping slow from place to place.</p>
<p class="i0">Reason is changed to nonsense, good to evil,</p>
<p class="i0">Art thou a grandson, woe betide thy case!</p>
<p class="i0">Of Law they prate, most falsely clept the Civil,</p>
<p class="i0">But for that right, which from our birth we carry,</p>
<p class="i0">’Tis not a word found in their Dictionary.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Your words have much increased my detestation.</p>
<p class="i0">O happy he, to whom such guide points out the way!</p>
<p class="i0">And now, I almost feel an inclination</p>
<p class="i0">To give Theology the sway.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">I have no wish to lead you astray.</p>
<p class="i0">As to this science, ’tis so hard to eschew</p>
<p class="i0">The false way, and to hit upon the true,</p>
<p class="i0">And so much hidden poison lurks within,</p>
<p class="i0">That’s scarce distinguished from the medicine.</p>
<p class="i0">Methinks that here ’twere safest done</p>
<p class="i0">That you should listen but to one,</p>
<p class="i0">And <i>jurare in verba magistri</i></p>
<p class="i0">Is the best maxim to assist thee.</p>
<p class="i0">Upon the whole, I counsel thee</p>
<p class="i0">To stick to words as much as may be,</p>
<p class="i0">For such will still the surest way be</p>
<p class="i0">Into the temple of certainty.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Yet in a word some sense must surely lurk.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Mephistopheles.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Yes, but one must not go too curiously to work;</p>
<p class="i0">For, just when our ideas fail us,</p>
<p class="i0">A well-coined word may best avail us.</p>
<p class="i0">Words are best weapons in disputing,</p>
<p class="i0">In system-building and uprooting,</p>
<p class="i0">To words most men will swear, though mean they ne’er so little,</p>
<p class="i0">From words one cannot filch a single tittle.</p>

<p class="is"><span class="spk">Student.</span></p>
<p class="i0">Pardon me, if I trespass on your time,</p>
<p class="i0">Though to make wisdom speak seems scarce a crime;</p>
<p class="i0">On medicine, too, I am concerned</p>
<p class="i0">To hear some pregnant word from one so learned.</p>
<p class="i0">Three years, God knows, is a short time,</p>
<p class="i0">And we have far to go, and high to climb;</p>
<p class="i0">A wise man’s fingers pointing to the goal</p>

<p class="i0">With milk and water nursed it carefully.</p>
<p class="i0">Thus in my arm, and on my lap, it grew,</p>

<p class="i0">I must awake;</p>
<p class="i0">Sometimes to give it drink, sometimes to take</p>
<p class="i0">It with me to my bed, and fondle it:</p>
<p class="i0">And when all this its fretting might not stay,</p>
<p class="i0">I rose, and danced about, and dandled it;</p>
<p class="i0">And after that I must away</p>
<p class="i0">To wash the clothes by break of day.</p>
<p class="i0">I make the markets too, and keep house for my mother,</p>
<p class="i0">One weary day just like another;</p>

thou concealed from me!&mdash;Stand thou there! stand!&mdash;Roll round thy
fiendish eyes, infuriate in thy head! Stand and confront me with thy
insupportable presence. A prisoner! in irredeemable misery! given over
to evil Spirits, and to the condemning voice of the unfeeling world!
and me, meanwhile, thou cradlest to sleep amid a host of the most
vapid dissipations, concealing from my knowledge her aggravated
woes!&mdash;while she&mdash;she is left in hopeless wretchedness to die!</p>

wanderer, now springing on his shoulders!&mdash;Change him again into his
favorite shape, that he may crouch on his belly in the sand before me,
and I may tramp him underneath my feet, the reprobate!&mdash;Not the first!
Misery, misery! by no human soul to be conceived! that more than one
creature of God should ever have been plunged into the depth of this
woe! that the first, in the writhing agony of her death, should not
have atoned for the guilt of all the rest before the eyes of the
All-merciful! It digs even into the marrow of my life, the misery of

murderer.</p>

That Faust might attain universal celebrity, the fame of authorship
could not be wanting. Besides being the reputed author of his own
life and exploits, published by his executor Wagner after his
death, there are extant magical works under his own name,&mdash;perhaps
not more authentic than those ascribed to Solomon,&mdash;of which one of
the most curious is reprinted by Horst, <i>Zauber Bibliothek</i>, vol.
iii. p. 86, with the following title, “Doctor J. Faust’s Book of
Miracles, Art, and Wonders, or the Black Raven,&mdash;also called the
Threefold Hell-compulsion; wherewith I compelled the Spirits to
bring me whatsoever things I pleased, whether gold or silver,
treasure great and small, and the springroot (a magic plant), and
whatever other such things are upon the earth; all this have I
brought to pass by means of this book, and was also able to dismiss
the spirits as often as I pleased.” The introduction to this book by
Doctor Faust himself is curious, but too long for insertion. The
warning, however, with which it concludes is too serious to be
omitted, “<i>Above all things, beware of entering into compacts with
these Spirits, that it may not fare with you as it has fared with
me.</i>”

<p class="i0"><i>And this mysterious magic page</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>From Nostradamus’ hand so sage.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>
Nostradamus was born at St. Remy, a town of Provence, in 1503, and
was a great friend of Julius Scaliger. He must thus have been
likewise a cotemporary of the famous alchymist Cornelius Agrippa,
whom, as we have seen (<i>Vide Introd. Remarks</i>), Del-Rio makes a
companion of Dr. Faust. Like a worthy son of the sixteenth century,
Nostradamus was convinced that he could make no progress in the art
of healing bodily diseases unless he began <i>ab ovo</i> with the study
of the stars; and this it was that led him away from his own
profession of medicine into the sublime regions of astronomy and
astrology, to which allusion is made in the text. He was
particularly famous for his prophetic almanacs, which were held in
universal estimation. The title of his principal work is “<i>The
true Prophecies and Prognostications of Michael Nostradamus,
physician to Henry II., Francis II., Charles IX., Kings of France,
and one of the best astronomers that ever were, a work full of
curiosity and learning</i>.” The English translation is from the hand
of Theophilus de Garenciennes, a naturalised Frenchman, and Oxonian
Doctor of Physic. The common edition is London, 1672.

<p class="i0"><i>He sees the sign of the Macrocosm.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>
The macrocosm is a Greek word signifying the <i>big world</i>, the
universe, as contrasted with the <i>little world</i>, the microcosm or
man, made in the likeness of God, and therefore in the likeness of
his great manifestation, the universe. The terms were in familiar
use with the theosophists of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries; as may be seen from the title-page of a great
physico-metaphysical book by our countryman, Robert Fludd, printed
at Oppenheim 1617-19, “<i>Utriusque Cosmi, majoris scilicet et
minoris, Metaphysica, Physica atque technica Historia, in duo
volumina, secundum, Cosmi differentiam divisa; auctore Roberto
Fludd, alias de Fluctibus, Armigero, et in Medicina Doctore
Oxoniensi</i>,” etc. The book is rare; but the curious may find a
beautiful copy in the Library of the Writers to the Signet,
Edinburgh.

<p class="i0"><i>The key of Solomon the wise</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>Is surest spell to exorcise.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>
Solomon was a magician among the Jews, for the same reason that
Roger Bacon has acquired that reputation amongst us&mdash;on account of
his great wisdom. The Jewish exorcists, of whom mention is made in
several passages of the New Testament (Matthew xii. 27), used to
invoke the evil spirit by the name of Solomon (Joseph. Antiq. 8, 2,
5, apud Bretschneider Dogmatik, vol. i. p. 764), and the cabalistic
talmudists were, of course, not negligent in taking advantage of
this popular belief for giving authority to their occult science of
numbers. Accordingly, we find Solomon, in the Middle Ages, looked
upon as the patriarch and patron-saint of the Magic Art; and many
curious books, under his name, were in common circulation among its
Professors. It is to the title of these books that the text alludes,
“<i>Clavicula Solomonis</i>,” or Key of Solomon, supposed to be of
supreme power in compelling spirits to obey the will of man. They
are now become exceedingly rare, but some notice of them will be
found in Reichard’s work <i>von Geistern</i>, and in Horst’s
<i>Zauber-Bibliothek</i>.

<p class="i0"><i>Silphe into ether flow,</i></p>
<p class="i0"><i>And Kobold vex him, drudging slave!</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>
Here we have the four elemental spirits, of which Mr. Pope has
discoursed so learnedly to Mrs. Anabella Fermor in his preface to
“The Rape of the Lock.” With Silphs and Salamanders I may
suppose the English reader sufficiently acquainted, as they have
been almost naturalised on British ground; Undenes and Kobolds still
remain more closely attached to their German soil. The former,
sometimes called <i>Wasser-Nixen</i>, are a sort of Teutonic Nymphs or
Sirens, familiar now to a large class of English readers, from
Heine’s ballad of the <i>Lurley</i>, and Fouque’s beautiful
extravaganza of <i>Undine</i>; the latter, seemingly from a Greek
original, κόβαλος, well known to the readers of Aristophanes, are
called <span class="sc">gnomes</span> by Pope, and appear as <i>brownies</i> in many a Scotch
ballad. For special details of their character and proceedings the
German work of Henning’s <i>von Geistern</i> may be consulted, p. 800,
and Horst’s <i>Zauber-Bibliothek</i>, vol. iv. p. 250.

“Inter alios plurimos characteres, duo tantum sunt veri et
præcipui, quorum primus constat ex duobus trigonis super se invicem
ita depictis ut Hexagonum constituant. Alterum dicunt esse priori
potentiorem et efficaciorem et esse pentagonon.”&mdash;<i>Paracelsus de
Characteribus apud Horst, Z. B.</i> vol. iii. p. 74. The figure thus
accurately described by the oracular Bombastus occurs almost as
frequently as the sign of the cross, in almost all the old books on
magic, and is drawn thus:

<div class="img_c">

<p>
The Platonists (let Proclus serve for an example) seem to have
derived from the Pythagoreans a strange mixture of religious
mysticism with a great enthusiasm for the mathematical sciences; and
this same pentagonal figure very probably derives not a little of
its supreme efficacy from the fact of its having been transmitted to
us from the most ancient times. Poetry is not the only thing that
receives a sacredness from age.

<p>
These nimble little animals, which play such a distinguished part in
this Witch Scene, are denominated in the original
“<i>Meer-katzen</i>,” literally “Sea-cats;” of which Adelung (in
voce) gives the following account:&mdash;“A name given to a certain
kind of monkeys with a cat’s tail, of which there are many
species,&mdash;<i>Cebus</i>, Linnæi. They are so called from coming across
the sea from warm countries.” I originally intended to retain the
German phrase “<i>Sea-cat</i>;” but afterwards had no hesitation to
adopt the happy translation given by the writer in <i>Blackwood’s
Magazine</i>, vol. vii. There is something mystical in the idea of an
animal half cat and half ape, which agrees wonderfully with the
witch-like antic character of this whole scene. Besides, the term
“Cat-ape” is far more expressive of the nature of the animal
than that in the original.

“According to the orthodox theory, the witches anointed their

<p>
A name of Satan, derived probably from the Latin <i>Volo</i>, through the
Italian <i>Volante</i>, expressive of that agile quality of the old
deceiver, whereby he is always “going to and fro on the earth, and
walking up and down in it.”&mdash;Job i. 7. See Reichard’s <i>Geister
Reich</i>, vol. i. p. 397. But I rather suspect this appellation is
connected with the office of the evil one, as chief of the flies,
and other volatile tormentors. In the French edition of the popular
story the devil is called “Le Diable volatique,” c. vi.;&mdash;or,
better still, the devil is so called as being “the prince of the
power of the air,” and therefore a flying spirit. “Mon Valet,
dis moi quel esprit es-tu?&mdash;Mon Maistre Faust, je suis un esprit
Volant, qui ay mon cours dans l’air sous le ciel”&mdash;in the same
French history of Doctor Faust.

<i>Lilith</i>, from <i>Lil</i>, darkness, is the name of night-monster
(translated <i>screech-owl</i> in Isaiah xxxiv. 14), who, under the
deceitful form of a beautiful woman, was believed by the Jews to be
most injurious to parturient women, and very often to occasion the
death of young persons before they were circumcised. Buxtorf, in his
Lexicon Talmudicum, gives a tolerably good account of these Hebrew
<i>Lamiæ</i>; but the most complete and satisfactory information on
this, as on all other subjects connected with ancient and modern
superstition, is to be found in Horst, <i>Zauber-Bibliothek</i>, part vi.

It is universally agreed that Nicolai, a noted Berlin publisher, who
flourished about the middle and towards the end of the last century,
is the person meant here. From his biography by Göcking, he appears
to have been a man of remarkable mental activity and considerable
literary significance in his day; but, like the Brandenburg sands on
which he was located, his ideas seemed to have been somewhat flat
and prosaic, and totally inadequate to grasp the significance of the
great master spirits of thought, who were now asserting their
rightful place on the platform of German literature. Notwithstanding
the prosaic character of his mind, he became subject to a disease of
seeing apparitions in clear daylight (see Dr. Hibbert’s book on
apparitions), an abnormal action of the optic nerves, which was
cured by the application of leeches to the part of the body on which
the unfeathered biped finds it comfortable to sit. Hence the name,
from the Greek πρωκτός.

Most of the puppet personages who pop up in this curious little
piece, and explain their own significance in a stanza, may be
presumed to be sufficiently familiar to all readers capable of
appreciating the mind of a poetical thinker such as Goethe. I
confine myself to the few following notes:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
<i>Embryo-Spirit</i>.&mdash;German “<i>Geist der sich erst bildet</i>.” A quiz
upon young versifiers,&mdash;poetlings with whom rhyme and reason are
opposite poles.
</p>

<p>
<i>Orthodox</i>.&mdash;We are indebted to the Fathers of the Church for the
pious imagination that the heathen gods were devils. Milton follows
the same unfounded idea. The gods of Greece were bad enough; but we
need not make them worse than they were. They had their good side
too. <i>Vide</i> Schiller’s beautiful poem, “The Gods of Greece,”
which, by the by, Frantz Horn calls “Ein unendlicher
Irrthum,”&mdash;an infinite error. But a man may admire an Apollo or a
Minerva without meaning to be a heathen.
</p>

<p>
<i>Purists</i>.&mdash;There are “purists” among the German grammarians;
but the allusion here must be to something else&mdash;prigs and
precisians, I fancy.
</p>

<p>
<i>Xenien</i>.&mdash;Epigrammatic poems published by Goethe and Schiller,
which were very severe on the half-poets of the day.
</p>

<p>
<i>Hennings</i>.&mdash;I know nothing of this character. Hayward says he was
one of the victims of the Xenien, and editor of two periodicals,
“<i>The Genius of the Age</i>,” and the “<i>Musaget</i>.”
</p>

<p>
The <i>stiff</i> man is Nicolai; he of the “old mill,” <i>supra</i>, p.
251. Nicolai was a great zealot against Catholics and Jesuits; but,
as Frantz Horn hints, his zeal was not always according to
knowledge.&mdash;<i>Geschichte der Deutschen Poesie</i>, vol. iii.

“This song is founded upon a popular German story, to be found in
the <i>Kinder-und Haus-Märchen</i> of the distinguished brothers Grimm,
under the title of <i>Van den Machandel-Boom</i>, and in the English
selection from that work (entitled <i>German Popular Stories</i>), under
the title of <i>The Juniper Tree</i>.&mdash;The wife of a rich man, whilst
standing under a juniper tree, wishes for a little child as white as
snow and as red as blood; and, on another occasion, expresses a wish
to be buried under the juniper when dead. Soon after, a little boy
as white as snow and as red as blood is born: the mother dies of joy
at beholding it, and is buried according to her wish. The husband
marries again, and has a daughter. The second wife, becoming jealous
of the boy, murders him, and serves him up at table for the
unconscious father to eat. The father finishes the whole dish, and
throws the bones under the table. The little girl, who is made the
innocent assistant in her mother’s villany, picks them up, ties
them in a silk handkerchief, and buries them under the juniper tree.
The tree begins to move its branches mysteriously, and then a kind
of cloud rises from it, a fire appears in the cloud, and out of the
fire comes a beautiful bird, which flies about singing the following

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
